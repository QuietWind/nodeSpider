        "detail": "How space is made is a simple question of which we assume to know the answer. Some have looked for it in eternity, others have looked back. For a while we believed in the future, but now also that belongs to the past. Unconvinced by neo-this and post-that we ask; what is architecture actually about?\nIn principle there are only two ways to make space; you can change the relation between floor and ceiling or add elements according to an order. Every action requires a spatial idea and the architectural model is its clearest expression. Models turn ideas into actions and become templates for the here and now.\nHesselbrand is an architecture practice based in London founded by Martin Brandsdal, Magnus Casselbrant and Jesper Henriksson. The work is focused on architecture that speaks to the present, and intervenes with patterns of daily life. Recent projects includes Prime, intergenerational housing for London, Three Found Models at the Revue Gallery in Soho and Home Economics at the Venice Architectural Biennale.\nImage: Model 3 from Three Found Models at the Revue Gallery in London, 2016.

        "detail": "For the last two years, t-sa forum has investigated the concept of ‘renewal’ in architecture in London as examples of how history is updated. This year, in parallel to the visiting school workshop at the AA, t-sa forum is organising a series of two conversations between established practitioners and recent AA graduates to discuss relationships between themes of renewal, structure and emotion.\nIn the second lecture of this series, architect Alun Jones will be in conversation with AA graduate Louise Underhill to discuss the dualities that arise when working with the existing fabric of cities. Alun will discuss Dow Jones’ refurbishment of the crypt at Christ Church, Spitalfields where, by opening up this subdivided space, they were able to make it converse with Hawksmoor’s material choices and joinery details in the church above. Here monumentality is reconciled with the human scale, the old conjoins with the new, and the church engages in new ways with the surrounding city. Similar issues about time, history, typology and making the past relevant to the contemporary context are echoed in Louise’s 5th year project, Framing: The Undoing of the Terraced House, where she interrogated the relationships between interior and exterior, front and back, upstairs and downstairs, the spaces of the adult, child, man, woman, work or domestic activities, and of the single versus the many. The project questions what constitutes a family home within the city today and proposes an architecture that does away with these binaries to advocate for a more layered understanding of space.\nAlun Jones studied architecture at the University of Bath and at the University of Cambridge. Between 1995 and 2000, he worked for Caruso St John Architects as project architect for the New Art Gallery, Walsall. In 2000, Alun established Dow Jones Architects with Biba Dow. He has taught widely at various schools of architecture. He is a visiting critic at various schools and an RIBA external examiner at the Glasgow University Mackintosh School. Alun is a Civic Trust Award assessor and on the various design review panels.\nLouise Underhill studied at Camberwell College of Arts and Goldsmiths University before continuing her studies in Architecture at the Architectural Association, graduating with honours in 2015. She was featured in the Wallpaper Graduate Directory 2015. She has worked at Carl Turner Architects and is currently working at 6a architects in London.",

The triennale examines both our attachment to places and collectivities—Where do we belong?—as well as our relation to the objects we own, share, and exchange—How do we manage our belongings?\nFor the first public presentation of the Triennale in London, After Belonging invites a group of architects and spatial practitioners to reflect on one of the proposals selected through an International Call for Intervention Strategies and that are being developed throughout the Triennale period. Nature, Labour, Land: A Public Spatial Archive for Kirkenes seeks to produce a forum of discussion for the construction of a new eco-political Arctic governance by operating on three negotiations in the region: the melting of the Arctic ice (Nature), the expected global shipment along the Northeast Passage (Labor), and the indigenous conception of the territory (Land). Participants will critically consider the intersection of non-human nature, indigenous rights and transnational labor.\nNature, Labour, Land: A Public Spatial Archive for Kirkenes is part of an ongoing series of forums and workshops initiated in January 2016 by Nabil Ahmed and Dámaso Randulfe, selected as one of the winner teams of the Call for Intervention Strategies of the Oslo Architecture Triennale 2016, and whose program of activities, interactions and interventions in each of the sites is developed throughout the year and culminated in an exhibition at the National Museum - Architecture in Oslo in September 2016.\nSpeakers include: Nabil Ahmed and Dámaso Randulfe (Authors, Nature, Labour, Land), Lindsay Bremner (Westminster University), Katya Larina, (U:lab.spb), Territorial Agency (John Palmesino and Ann-Sofi Rönnskog).

        "detail": "Today, we can fabricate anything. Complexity and customisation are no longer constraints. Yet there is a discrepancy between the wonder of digital fabrication technology, and the conventionalism of our designs. Put simply: we can fabricate more than we can design. \nWe need a new type of design instrument. We need tools for search and exploration, rather than simply control and execution. These tools will no longer require words, labels or categories, as they must create the previously unseen. Knowledge and experience will be acquired through search and mining. As of yet, we have countless tools to increase our efficiency and precision. Now is the time to create tools to inspire us and to help us be creative: the machine as our muse!\nMichael Hansmeyer is an architect and programmer who explores the use of computational design and digital fabrication to create architectural form. Recent projects include the Sixth Order installation of columns at the Gwangju Design Biennale, and the design and fabrication of a 3D printed grotto for an Archilab exhibition. He is currently a visiting professor at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.",

In his lecture, Ben van Berkel will discuss the role of the contemporary station as both an urban activator and the agent of an elevated passenger experience. He will present the main ambitions and the key strategies behind the design for Arnhem Central and will examine a number of related UNStudio projects that enabled the testing and development of similar concepts. \nBen van Berkel, born in Utrecht, the Netherlands, is the Founder and Principal Architect of UNStudio in Amsterdam, Shanghai and Hong Kong. Ben van Berkel studied architecture at the Rietveld Academy in Amsterdam and at the Architectural Association in London, receiving the AA Diploma with Honours in 1987. He was recently awarded the Kenzo Tange Visiting Professor’s Chair at Harvard University Graduate School of Design. UNStudio is a network of specialists in architecture, urban development and infrastructure. Current projects include the design for Doha’s Intregrated Metro network in Qatar, the Raffles City mixed-use development in Hangzhou and the Canaletto Tower in London.\nImage: Arnhem Station by UN Studio, Hufton + Crow\nPlease note:This lecture will be ticketed with priority given to AA students, staff and members.",

In this discussion, she will discuss the challenges they faced then with one member of that original group and two other former students.  However the focus of discussion will be on the current generation, is education different and what does this mean for the future? \nImage: Students in the Back Members' Room, circa 1970 © AA Photo Library",

Design for resilient and sustainable health infrastructure  involves a multiplicity of actors, collaborating across disciplines of medicine, science and architecture with a collective sensibility infused with the poetry of visual arts. \nSchedule\n10:00 am = Opening RemarksProf. Lord Hunt of Chesterton, Symposium Chair10.15 am= Albania: Urbanism & Social ChangeUlrike Bega, Architect; Principal of SymbioticA, Office of Architecture, Urbanism & Sustainable Design10:45 am = Architecture & Integrated Design for Emerging MedicareBob Wills RIBA, Director of Medical Architecture Practice11:15 am = Promoting Public Health in Post-Soviet CulturesProfessor Dr Parveen Kumar CBE11:45 am = Architecture, Art & KidsHealth: Current Project at Tirana Children's Hospital Elsie Owusu OBE & Donna Hasanaj RIBA12:15 pm - 1.00pm = Round table discussion (chair Prof Lord Hunt)\nLUNCH\n2:00 pm = Ghana National Hospitals Programme: An Exemplary Case Study Jonathan Darke RIBA, TP Bennets Architects2:30pm = Spectrum of Health: Micro to Macro Azhar RIBA, Architect Cultural Conversations & Agency for Positive Change Vanessa Norwood, AA Head of Exhibitions3:00pm = Tirana: Pollution, Air Quality & Environmental HealthAmy Sidworthy, Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants3.30pm = Albania's Economy: Challenges and OpportunitiesDame Frances Cairncross DBE, Economist\n4.00 PM: BREAK\n4:30pm = Healthcare: A Catalyst for Albania's Economic TransformationErion Veliaj, Mayor of Tirana  5pm = Round table discussion (chair Lord Hunt)5.30pm - Closing Remarks6pm - 7.30pm: RECEPTION & NETWORKING",

        "detail": "Minnette de Silva (1918-1998) was the daughter of a prominent Sinhalese politician called George de Silva and grew up in Kandy during the last decades of the British Raj. Having set her mind on becoming an architect she studied  in Bombay during the War and worked for a time with Otto Koenigsberger in Mysore. She was a student at the AA between 1945 and 1948 and became the first Asian woman to become an associate of the RIBA.  \nMinnette practised from her parent’s home in Kandy and was prolific during the 1950s and 1960s.  Her work combined the modernism of her friend le Corbusier with traditional methods of construction and decoration. During this period she was an associate editor of MARG magazine in Bombay which she had helped to found with her sister in 1945 and authored a number of prescient articles which proposed a theory of ‘Regional Modernism’.\nHer practice foundered after 1970 and, after a brief spell in London, she moved to Hong Kong as a lecturer and pioneered a new approach to the historiography of Asian architecture.  Returning to Sri Lanka in 1980 she tried unsuccessfully to revive her practice and she died, penniless, in 1998.\nMinnette was a pioneer of post-independence architecture in Sri Lanka and there is little doubt that her both her buildings and her writings had a huge influence on  Geoffrey Bawa whose architectural career ran about ten years after her own.  But she was hindered by the fact of being a woman in what had been hitherto an exclusively male-profession and by her relative isolation in the provincial backwaters of Kandy. She has never garnered the recognition that she richly deserves: the first part of her auto-biography ‘The Life and Work of an Asian Woman Architect’ appeared soon after her death, but it was unedited and failed to do her justice.  Her archives and many of her buildings have since disappeared.\nBartlett graduate David Robson first met Minnette de Silva when he was a lecturer in the Colombo School of Architecture between 1969 and 1972.  Ten years later he returned to Sri Lanka as an adviser on the Government’s ‘100,000 Houses Programme’ and lived for three years in a house designed by Minnette. Subsequently a Professor of Architecture in the University of Brighton, he is the author of books on Sri Lankan architects Geoffrey Bawa and C. Anjalendran and recently published ‘The Architectural Heritage of Sri Lanka’.\nImage: CIAM Bridgewater 1947  (Minnette de Silva is in front row next to Walter Gropius).",

Why, then, does disability remain stuck in the language of function and regulation, in an entirely atheoretical and ahistorical space? In this talk Jos discusses what can happen to architecture and its practices if ‘normal’ (and normative) assumptions about disability – and ability - are challenged creatively and critically. She will argue that thinking differently about dis/ability can have unexpected effects across common sense architectural understandings as to what constitutes it’s theories, histories, practices and technologies.\nLeading up to the centenary of women at the Architectural Association in 2017, a series of lectures organised by AA XX 100 over three years, will draw different generations, disciplines and voices into a wider conversation and celebration of women and their contribution to architecture. Through presentations, dialogue and debate, the series will highlight and challenge the concerns and values of the profession which recognises the inclusive and collaborative nature of architecture, while serving as a catalyst for bigger ideas and a wider discussion of how to address ongoing issues of inequality and too little diversity within the industry. The series will feature prominent practitioners from contemporary architecture, design and urbanism, creating engaging conversations between past and present, men and women, staff and students.\nJos Boys trained in architecture and has worked in community-based practice, journalism, education and research. She is author of Doing Disability Differently: an alternative handbook on architecture, dis/ability and designing for everyday life and is currently editing an architecture and disability Reader.\nImage: Exercise in Losing Control by Noemi Lakmaier\nPlease note: there will be a ramp at the entrance to No.36 Bedford Square for access to the Lecture Hall, and there is a disabled toilet in the same building around the back (also accessed by ramp). \nFor more information on disabled parking near the AA, please visit: http://beta.maps.camden.gov.uk/#/home/Disabled%20blue%20badge/location/WC1B%203ES",

        "detail": "Feel at home in Paris, New York, London, Tokyo and Berlin; simultaneously. \n“Home”, once a personal “fortress of solitude”, now an online commodity everywhere, marks a tidal shift in a subtle transition towards a newfound sharing economy. As our notions of the public, private, temporary, permanent, generic and specific, are yet again challenged by indistinguishability. We, who \"arrive as locals\" and  \"belong anywhere,\" must recondition our archaic understanding of mobility and domesticity in an ever-increasing world of virtual “sharing”, and its inherent archetype of ‘nomadicity’; we must update the way we construct not just our built environment, but relationships among ourselves, and our possessions. However, in desirable urban spaces, AirBnB is facilitating the cultivation of a gentrified monoculture that jeopardizes diversity. Consequently, an AirBnB neighborhood is not a profitable means to collectively consume, but an international bedroom community of \"post-tourist\" mobile workers. AirBnB makes cities more affordable, as its influx of guests undertakes a much more utilitarian approach to the urban realm, yet raises questions as to whether this form of social behavior liberates or further entraps our society; as these newly administered laws of exchange slowly relieve us of a sense of ownership and identity.\nPerhaps the homo-economicus does not fully comprehend the urban implications of their contribution to gentrification, but will it matter once everywhere wears the same nordic furniture, stocks the same chicken sandwich, and pours the same Seattle coffee?\nAlex Stephany: CEO of JustPark, a sharing economy startup, Alex closed the largest equity crowdfunding for a startup in history. He is author of the latest accalimed sharing economy book, The Business of Sharing and provides expert comment on the sharing economy and startups and have appeared on Bloomberg, FOX, Sky News, NPR, BBC World and the BBC's Today Programme among others.

Greene has made a career of pursuing projects that seek to deepen contemporary architectural investigation of form, and its relation to information technology and technology at large.\nJohn Palmesino: John is an architect and urbanist, born in Switzerland. He has lead the researches at ETH Studio Basel–Contemporary City Institute between 2003 and 2007.He has co-founded Multiplicity, an international research network involved in contemporary architecture, urbanism, arts and general culture.

        "detail": "Former Domus editor and curator of the first Istanbul Design Biennial, Joseph Grima, has set what is being called a new beginning in curatorial representation of the global state of architecture, through the 2015 Chicago Biennial. The Biennial sought not to simply conceive another tourist-oriented event, but a substantial platform for a network of local institutions and their respective programs to showcase international contemporary architecture.\nTitled “The State of the Art of Architecture,” the exhibition is a comprehensive concoction ranging from sustainability to housing, and resilience to social justice, with the intention not to overshadow or highlight any architectural ideologies, such as neo-postmodernism. This curatorial position was swiftly denounced by parametricist Patrik Schumacher, claiming that anything “I recognize as contemporary architecture was missing” from the exhibition, as highly ideological architectural styles are not just evident in today’s architectural explorations but also deeply interwoven into our daily lives; thus criticizing his lack of invitation.\nAt risk of being criticized for a lack of focus and selective prejudice, the biennial suggests that the contemporary is open to expression and interpretation. \nIf the Chicago Biennial failed to coherently articulate contemporary architecture, how do we define what is contemporary architecture and its relevant thrust? And what role do Biennials play in such definition, and the representation of global architectural trends?\nDebaters:\nJoseph Grima (UK) - Since 2011, Joseph Grima has been the editor of Domus and was also co-curator of the first Instanbul Design Biennial.

The prize was awarded to the collective for their recent projects, which include the urban regeneration work they are undertaking in Granby Four Streets, Liverpool.  Here, the collective is working with inhabitants on direct actions to prevent the terraced houses on site from demolition and falling further into disrepair through nurturing public engagement and collaboration, offering local training and promoting a culture of DIY and making by setting up the Granby Workshop as a new social enterprise that draws on the artisan legacy of the area. In this lecture, as part of our AA XX 100 series that this year focuses on inclusivity, we will discuss how Assemble is blurring the boundaries across disciplines - making architectural activism and self-build interventions get recognition as a form of artistic practice. As their winning citation for the Turner Prize stated, they have the ability to “draw on long traditions of artistic and collective initiatives that experiment in art, design and architecture. In doing so they offer alternative models to how societies can work.” \nLeading up to the centenary of women at the Architectural Association in 2017, a series of lectures organised by AA XX 100 over three years, will draw different generations, disciplines and voices into a wider conversation and celebration of women and their contribution to architecture.

        "detail": "The symposium brings together urban educators to discuss how new practices and research have changed urban design conventions and disciplinary assumptions. This is a discussion not only important to urban researchers, but all architects involved in the different scales of designing the built environment.  While the term ‘urban design’ originates from a conference at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956, this was not the first time that the urban was defined as a problem arising between planning and design. Ildefons Cerdà already recognised this a century earlier when coining the term ‘urbanisation’. Also, rather than considering urban design as an academic field with practical orientation that operates between architecture, landscape architecture and planning as an inter-, intra, multi- or cross-disciplinary practice, what if its value is not a management of differences, but the instrumentalisation of conflicts?   The resurgence of urban design education and research is only partially explained by global urbanisation, or the failure of other design disciplines to make meaningful claims to ‘urbanism’. Contemporary urban research challenges the commonly held belief that the urban requires a homogenising intervention and process. The approach of unifying the urban through ideas of place-making, nostalgia for past public spaces, or the codification of ‘good’ urban form is no longer tenable. Instead, richer multi-scalar design research enquiries are emerging, which, for example, make a simultaneous consideration of domesticity, typology, morphology, infrastructure and territory possible. A particular strength of urban design hereby is a framing of abstract contexts such as policy, legal frameworks and planning through considerations of specific constituencies, urban plans, design frameworks, design proposals and physical implementation.   The symposium seeks to clarify how teaching and research methodologies can have a relevance and impact on urban practices and design.

        "detail": "The symposium brings together urban educators to discuss how new practices and research have changed urban design conventions and disciplinary assumptions. This is a discussion not only important to urban researchers, but all architects involved in the different scales of designing the built environment.While the term ‘urban design’ originates from a conference at the Harvard Graduate School of Design in 1956, this was not the first time that the urban was defined as a problem arising between planning and design. Ildefons Cerdà already recognised this a century earlier when coining the term ‘urbanisation’. Also, rather than considering urban design as an academic field with practical orientation that operates between architecture, landscape architecture and planning as an inter-, intra, multi- or cross-disciplinary practice, what if its value is not a management of differences, but the instrumentalisation of conflicts? The resurgence of urban design education and research is only partially explained by global urbanisation, or the failure of other design disciplines to make meaningful claims to ‘urbanism’. Contemporary urban research challenges the commonly held belief that the urban requires a homogenising intervention and process. The approach of unifying the urban through ideas of place-making, nostalgia for past public spaces, or the codification of ‘good’ urban form is no longer tenable. Instead, richer multi-scalar design research enquiries are emerging, which, for example, make a simultaneous consideration of domesticity, typology, morphology, infrastructure and territory possible. A particular strength of urban design hereby is a framing of abstract contexts such as policy, legal frameworks and planning through considerations of specific constituencies, urban plans, design frameworks, design proposals and physical implementation. The symposium seeks to clarify how teaching and research methodologies can have a relevance and impact on urban practices and design.Schedule\n10:20 am = Welcome (Sam Jacoby, AA Projective Cities)10:30 am = 'Representative Cities', Ingrid Schröder (Cambridge University)11:10 am = 'Urban Design in China: Practice and Challenges', Dr Fei Chen (University of Liverpool)11:50 am = 'The New Urban Professional: Experiments in Pedagogy', Prof Diego Ramírez-Lovering (Monash University)12:30 pm = Round table discussion (chair Prof Peter Bishop, UCL)\n----\n2:00 pm = 'Private Investigations', Prof Alexander Lehnerer (ETH)2:40 pm = 'Propositions for Urban Design Research', Dr Sam Jacoby (AA)3:20 pm = 'Architecture of Territory', Prof Milica Topalovic (ETH)4:00 pm = 'Scales as Pedagogy', Dr Adrian Lahoud (RCA) 4:40 pm = 'Linking the Physical to the Social', Prof Ricky Burdett (LSE)5:30 pm = Round table discussion (chair Tarsha Finney, UTS)\nIngrid Schröder is a practicing architect and the founding Director of the Cambridge Design Research Studio.

        "detail": "Not a day goes by without a biennial of art or architecture opening somewhere on earth. They’re the cultural format of choice in a habitually overcultured world. They often privilege the same criteria (where potency is measured by size) and rely on the market to be realised (while critiquing the market, content wise). Have biennials fallen into a default mannerism? Is the format exhausted? What would experimentation, innovation and iconoclasm look like? Shumon Basar invites a number of recent biennial directors to discuss these the dilemmas of Biennialing.\nNicola Lees was the curator of the 31st Biennial of Graphic Arts in Ljubljana, which took place in 2015. Between 2013 and 2015 Nicola was the curator for Frieze Projects, the annual not-for-profit programme featuring artist commissions, film, and music at Frieze London. She was previously Senior Curator of Public Programmes at the Serpentine Gallery, London, where she oversaw interdisciplinary, time-based and performance projects, artist commissions, initiating Park Nights and the Serpentine Cinema series, and realizing the Serpentine Gallery Marathon (co-curated with Hans Ulrich Obrist).\nElvira Dyangani Ose was the curator of the 8th edition of the Göteborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art, which took place in 2015. Prior to that, Elvira was Curator International Art at Tate Modern.

        "detail": "Summarising several research projects on design systems, I revisit some of the most influential “diagrammatic” practices of the 1990’s – 2000’s – from OMA and SANAA to UN Studio and MVRDV. Considering the design methods, tools and techniques behind the revival of the design ‘infrastructures’ and frameworks, I focus on the diagram – its theoretical inflations and deflations, practical successes and failures. The case studies tackle key design tensions and inconsistencies – between abstract and concrete, analytical and projective, programmatic and formal - exposing both persistent problems and under-utilised potentials of the now-suspect diagrammatic approach. In contrast to return to the incomplete historical pursuit not its abandonment in the world after-the-diagram, I argue for the redirection and the next chapter of both contingent and consistent disciplinary project. Ultimately, lighter, looser and more “plastic” design approaches are a better fit for contemporary contexts and practices.\nMaria Fedorchenko is a Diploma 8 Unit Master, and has been involved in HTS, Housing & Urbanism and the Visiting School Programmes at the AA since 2008.

        "detail": "As stated by the philosopher Georges Canguilhelm, the concept of environment would become in the 1950s a basic category of contemporary though. In the architectural debates it would find its counterpart in notions like habitat (CIAM), cluster (Alison & Peter Smithson) or environment (Reyner Banham) through which the relation of man with his natural, social or artificial milieu was to be studied. It provoked a shift from an interest for the architectural form (modernism), to that of the environment and the different media flowing, circulating or running through or around the building (post-modernism). But how did theses debates transform architectural design? How did this new interest inform the architectural practice? And how was it to be represented? The talk proposes to address these issues through the work of the british architect James Stirling.\nLaurent Stalder is professor for the theory of architecture at the Swiss Institute of Technology. The main focus of his research and publications is the history and theory of architecture from the 19th to the 21st centuries where it intersects with the history of technology. His most recent publications include Hermann Muthesius: Das Landhaus als kulturgeschichtlicher Entwurf (2008), Valerio Olgiati (2008), Der Schwellenatlas (2009), and God & Co. François Dallegret: Beyond the Bubble (2011), Atelier Bow Wow. A Primer (2013), Fritz Haller: Architekt und Forscher (2015). His articles have been published in various journals, including AA Files, Arch+, Greyroom, the Journal of Architecture, Werk, Bauen & Wohnen and the Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte. He is currently preparing a monograph „Charting the Environment“ on British Architecture 1930-1970.\nImage caption: Nordheim-Westfalen Museum, Düsseldorf, James Stirling, 1975.",

        "detail": "In an age where technology weaves itself further through the fabric of quotidian life – from Apple Pay, 3D Printing and Drones to the Google Car and the employment of automated systems – the human is slowly relieved of its duties, in an effort to increasing her leisure and enriching her spiritual life. However, in this, the architectural profession is not exempt. In a transition that postulates the architect’s potential self demise through the implementations of these digital tools, what could be the beginning of the end of architectural transcendence in man, who shall concern itself with building, man or machine? Or both?\nPatrik Schumacher (DE) - Current director of Zaha Hadid Architects, architect and theorist Patrik, founder of the AA DRL Programme, has long been involved in computational design and automated systems. Author of the two-part series The Autopoiesis of Architecture, through parametric theory, Patrik proposes a new architectural framework delving into a ceaseless sense of architectural auto-reproduction. \nClemens Weisshaar (DE) - Clemens Weisshaar began as a metal worker and studied product design at Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design and the Royal College of Art in London. He now runs Kram/Weisshaar which has been referred to as \"the poster boys\" of \"vanguard next generation digital designers\", affluent in knowledge of digital fabrication, robotic technologies and artificial intelligence. \nFrancesca Hughes (UK) - Francesca Hughes has taught extensively in London through the Bartlett School of Architecture and the AA, as well as lectured globally at other architecture institutions. Currently co-leading Hughes Meyer studio, and author of many publications - most notably The Architecture of Error: Matter, Measure and the Misadventures of Precision - Francesca questions the involvement of technology in the digital design process and its contribution in \"reducing\" human error. What if this pivotal cultural and technological transition is considered as an unspoken horror of loss of control over human error? \nRyan Dillon (USA) - Ryan Dillon received his Bachelor of Architecture at Syracuse University School of Architecture and his MA from the Histories and Theories programme at the AA. Having worked at Moshe Safdie Architects, Ryan is now a designer at EGG Office and teacher in the AA’s undergraduate History & Theory programme and the Architecture and Urbanism graduate programme (DRL), and teaches a Intermediate Unit 5, where he reserves a special interest in the relationship between emergent technologies and how they are interwoven in our daily lives and the role.\nFrancesco Catemario di Quadri (IT/PT/CH) - Francesco, currently a third year student has been a student at the AA since foundation, ex Inter 6 and currently in Inter 5.  \nJakob Skote (SE) - Jakob, currently a third year student has been a student at the AA since second year, ex Inter 11 and currently in Inter 14.  \nAside from the panel, the debate will hold 2 Open Seats for audience members that are invited by the mediator that are willing to join the panel. ",

        "detail": "Salvador Dalí invented the ‘paranoid-critical method’ as a means to exploit the creative potential of associative thinking. It has since informed a multitude of practices, from the literary avant-garde to military stratagems. Tom McCarthy’s recent novel Satin Island tracks the method’s bastard contemporary offspring through the intersections of architecture, urbanism, design and cutting-edge consultancy. It does so in relation to one of modernity’s other grand assumptions, the ‘Great Report ‘ - a putative compendium borne of the belief that an almost absurd variety of material can be compiled and given meaning in a singular form. Is such a report ‘writable’? Has digital culture, with it endless capacity for horizontal archiving, perhaps been compiling it all along without our aid? What space does that leave for creativity - or, for that matter, dissent?\nTom McCarthy is a writer and artist whose work has been translated into more than twenty languages. His first novel, Remainder, which deals with questions of trauma and repetition, won the 2008 Believer Book Award and was recently adapted for the cinema. His third, C, which explores the relationship between melancholia and technological media, was shortlisted for the 2010 Booker Prize, as was his fourth, Satin Island, in 2015. McCarthy is also author of the 2006 non-fiction book Tintin and the Secret of Literature, an exploration of the themes and patterns of Hergé’s comic books; of the novel Men in Space, set in a Central Europe rapidly disintegrating after the collapse of communism; and of numerous essays that have appeared in publications such as The New York Times, The London Review of Books, Harper’s and Artforum. In addition, he is founder and General Secretary of the International Necronautical Society (INS), a semi-fictitious avant-garde network of writers, philosophers and artists whose work has been exhibited internationally at venues including the Palais de Tokyo Paris, Tate Britain and Moderna Museet Stockholm. In 2013 he was awarded the inaugural Windham Campbell Prize for Fiction by Yale University.\nMark Campbell is the Director of the MPhil in Media Practices and Paradise Lost AA Research Cluster.

Engaging wild minds from the fields of art, design, technology and science in discussion, to explore how the tools available to creative minds activate design thinking in peculiar, particular ways.\nEver wondered what your neurons are up to as you sketch and make; as you lure and provoke your ideas into being? Weapons of Choice Part I; The Architect and the Brain Scientist, brings together the fabulously speculative mind of Architect and Academic Perry Kulper in conversation with leading cognitive neuroscientist, Professor Vincent Walsh to engage in an interrogation of creative practice.  Kulper’s speculative work engages the territory of the drawing as a site of exuberant exploration and he will be discussing curiosity cabinets, flat out hunches, relational structuring, design methods - particularly analogic thinking, specific representation techniques for working and the use of language as a generative technology. Walsh, who has worked extensively with artists and musicians, brings an insight into the workings of the brain during creative acts, as we ask how the doing affects the thinking and to what extent it is possible to manipulate or nurture creativity.  Conversation will be chaired and stirred by Kate Davies.\n--\nPerry Kulper is an architect and Associate Professor of Architecture at the University of Michigan’s Taubman College of Architecture + Urban Planning. His interests include the generative potential of architectural drawing, the outrageously different spatial capacities of diverse design methods and in broadening the conceptual range by which architecture contributes to our cultural imagination. He has recently published Pamphlet Architecture 34, Fathoming the Unfathomable: Archival Ghosts and Paradoxical Shadows with Nat Chard. Prior to his arrival at the University of Michigan he was a SCI-Arc faculty member for 17 years as well as in visiting positions at the University of Pennsylvania and Arizona State University. Subsequent to his studies at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (BS Arch) and Columbia University (M Arch) he worked in the offices of Eisenman/ Robertson, Robert A.M. Stern and Venturi, Rauch and Scott Brown before moving to Los Angeles. \nVincent Walsh is Professor of Human Brain Research at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience at University College London and a world expert on the brain and performance. Walsh’s Research Group is now entirely concerned with using modern brain science to change behaviour and performance in the world beyond the lab. In that space beyond the lab he has been scientific advisor to the Southbank on the presentation of Messiaen's synaesthesia, Scientist in Residence at the Royal Academy of Music, where he organised the first joint meeting of The Royal Society and The Royal Academy of Music on Creativity and the Brain, and chair of the Medicine and Music symposium at the Royal College of Medicine. He is also the scientific organiser of the British Library annual Science Symposium. He has just completed a Royal Society Industry Research Fellowship which will result in a new clinic for brain stimulation and depression. He also engages with public projects in the media and his work has featured on radio, television and in print media. As a scientist he has published 225 scientific papers on vision, awareness, time perception, music, synaesthesia and technical aspects of brain stimulation. \nKate Davies is an artist and architect.

Director Brett Steele will interview Elizabeth and Ricardo about their personal experiences developing New York City’s High Line. \nThis conversation is part of the Blueprint 20/20 Series, in which influential practitioners look back on seminal projects, providing retrospective insight as well as reflective lessons. Over a decade since Elizabeth and Ricardo first surveyed the site, Brett will ask the designers to reflect on lessons learned, unforeseen challenges, and the unexpected impact the park has had re-shaping global perceptions of urban space.\nThis programme has been coordinated in conjunction with the release of The High Line (Phaidon), the first book to fully chart the transformation of a historic elevated railway in New York into a world famous public park. The book documents the creative process, from concept to completion, of the High Line by members of the design team at the centre of its creation – James Corner Field Operations and Diller Scofidio + Renfro.\nPLEASE NOTE:this event is ticketed and tickets are now sold out. \nThe lecture will be relayed to the Rear Second Presentation Space and the New Soft Room. Tickets are NOT required for these areas but access will be on a first-come-first-served basis and once the areas are full access will be denied.\nSigned copies of the book will be sold at a special price of £40.00 (RRP £49.95) which can be purchased online while reserving your seat (to be collected at the lecture) or at the event.

        "detail": "The title of this lecture came from the two volumes of essays published recently by Architectural Association. The two adjectives, “natural” and “small,” are essential in both real and metaphoric senses to describe Kengo Kuma’s approach to design.\nIn Kuma’s work, “natural” does not always refer to materials or landscape. It is a statement of objection to modern archi- tecture dominated by concrete throughout the 20th century, which severed ties between human beings and their locations. Inspired by his own experience of working with craftsmen in provincial Japan, and with hints from the radical design philosophies of Bruno Taut and Frank Lloyd Wright, Kuma continues to seek potentials in the uses of water, stone, wood, earth, and paper. Then in “small” architecture, the expression is used as an antithesis to giant, forceful, and inflexible systems and constructions that Kuma found desperately powerless in the wake of Japan’s 3.11 disaster in 2011. He encourages the public to look back at the environment they are given, and to then consider architecture from a personal level. Through basic acts such as stacking, weaving, or inflating, human-friendly units can rebuild spaces that are truly safe and comfortable. In effect, Kuma suggests that “small” and “natural” mean being indepen- dent and democratic in our time.\nKengo Kuma was born in 1954. He completed his master’s degree at the University of Tokyo in 1979. After studying at Columbia University as Visiting Scholar, he established Kengo Kuma & Associates 1990. In 2009, he was installed as Professor at the Graduate School of Architecture, University of Tokyo.\nAmong Kuma’s major works are Kirosan Observatory (1995), Water/Glass (1995, received AIA Benedictus Award), Stage in Forest, Toyoma Center for Performance Arts (received 1997 Architectural Institute of Japan Annual Award), Bato-machi Hiroshige Museum (received The Murano Prize). Recent works include Nezu Museum (2009, Tokyo), Yusuhara Marche and Wooden Bridge Museum (2010), Asakusa Culture and Tourism Center (2012), Nagaoka City Hall Aore. (2012), and Kabukiza (2013). Outside Japan, Besancon Music Center, FRAC Marseilles Aix-en-Provence Conservatoire, and China Academy of Arts’ Folk Art Museum have been completed recently, with lots of major projects being underway, including V&A at Dundee, UK.\nKuma is also a prolific writer and his books have been translated into English, Chinese and Korean, obtaining wide readership from around the world. The latest titles are Natural Architecture and Small Architecture, published from Architectural Association.\nPLEASE NOTE: This lecture will be ticketed with priority given to AA Students, Members & Staff. \nAA Students can collect a ticket on Monday, 16 November at 9.30am from Reception in No.36 Bedford Square.

        "detail": "We must start speaking about workers again, with programmes and projects that concern them directly, existentially.Mario Tronti, ‘Politics at Work’, 2008\nIn her book The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt distinguishes labour from work. While work is the production of things that may be more enduring than the life of its producer (like a pot or a poem), labour is the sheer unending business of life reproduction: cooking, cleaning, giving birth, raising kids, taking care of the household. According to Arendt, labour is merely a performative activity confined within the space of the house that does not leave anything material behind. With the rise of industrialisation and the increasing division of labour, the distinction between labour and work does not exist anymore and the subjectivity of animal laborans becomes the fundamental datum of modern society. Within modernity labour no longer addresses a specific sphere of the human condition but the totality of life, since under capitalism it is life as bios that is put to work and made productive. As Karl Marx wrote in a crucial passage of Das Kapital ‘labour power is the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in the physical form, the living personality, of a human being’. This means that what is at stake in the concept of labour is not the production of things, but the production of the most crucial commodity within a capitalistic economy: subjectivity. Production of subjectivity becomes the fundamental goal of a capitalistic economy.In this sense it is impossible to define the modern city and its architecture without understanding it through the lens of labour. And yet until today, with very few notable exceptions, very little has been written on the relationship between labour and architecture. While issues such as public space, politics, capitalism, neoliberalism and the commodification of the built environment are widely discussed, labour has rarely been confronted by the culture of architecture. The reason for this lack of discussion may be the ubiquity of labour itself as both spatial and social condition of our life. The symposium gathers for the first time a group of researchers who will attempt to read the relationship between labour and architecture in different contexts, from the intimacy of domestic space to the abstraction of post-industrial forms of production, to the role of the architect as producer. Rather than offering a comprehensive historical mapping, the symposium will offer critical insights towards a new understanding of architecture through the concept of labour.\n - Pier Vittorio Aureli \nProgramme:\n10.20 – 11.00 Pier Vittorio Aureli (Architectural Association, Dogma, The City as a Project)Labour and Architecture: Notes in the Form of an IntroductionThis paper will tentatively define a relationship between labour and architecture in which labour is not simply the ‘content’ of architecture, but the condition within which both architectural form and architecture as profession have been historically structured. With the rise of labour as both the driving economic force and the source of political conflicts within the city, architecture becomes an assemblage of elements whose goal is no longer to represent power, but to effect power by framing, enabling, eliciting, making accessible or excluding. Moreover it is precisely by confronting the conflictual ethos of the labour force that architecture as specialised profession was born as a way to politically sabotage the guilds’ influence on the city government. Departing from Marx and Hannah Arendt’s definition of the category of labour, I will discuss exemplary case studies in which architecture both as labouring process and as built or designed form reflects both the organisation of productive and reproductive labour and the conflicts this organisation has triggered within the history of capitalism. As coda to my intervention I will introduce the contributions to the symposium as attempts to ponder the condition of labour from the factory to the home, from the construction industry to the organisation of one’s own life.\n11.00 – 11.40Francesco Marullo (Rotterdam Academy of Architecture, Behemoth Press, The City as a Project)The Measure of Emptiness: Notes on the Architecture of the Factory and the Logistic OrderThe factory could be defined as the very first architecture of the ‘whole’. More than a building, it embodies a complex system of spatial and labour relations extending far beyond the limits of its enclosure. The factory is able to convey the wide reality of production in all its distinct phases into a present and tangible form, from the extraction of materials kilometres away to the assembling of products and their final distribution across foreign lands.Its architecture is entirely derived from the necessities of production rather than from formal composition: the very notion of plan in the factory is replaced by a purely technical scheme – or layout – organising the logistic chain of operations and combining spaces with movements for an efficient management of workers and machinery. Yet, the logistic order of the factory did not only pertain to manufacture, but gradually penetrated every field of production – from heavy industry to domestic architecture, from office buildings to universities – transforming assembly lines into ‘think-belts’, smoothing functional and sequential arrangements into open spaces and flexible plans, disguising coercion as neutral free competition or cooperation.This short presentation will go through a series of plans, investigating old and present day ‘factories’, their forms of exploitation and subjection of labour-power vis-à-vis the unavoidable genericness of the architecture of production.\n11.40 – 12.20 Maria S Giudici (Architectural Association, Black Square, The City as a Project)Familles, je vous hais! On Architecture and Reproductive LabourFar from being a haven of tranquility, the house is not only the battlefield of social and personal conflicts of class, gender and ethnicity, but is also arguably the most important workplace. However, while in the pre-modern era the productive vocation of the home was not qualified, the refined division of labour that is a hallmark of early capitalism expelled the production of goods from the home, leaving behind the unwaged and unseen toil of women. The institutionalisation of reproductive labour, that is to say the sum of the efforts needed to generate, maintain, educate and care for the workforce, is perhaps the single most effective act of primitive accumulation we can imagine; in this process, half of the population is dispossessed of any control of their work which becomes a simple, natural destiny sweetened by the trappings of domesticity and familial love. The home of the middle and working classes, which had hardly been a concern for European architects until the late Renaissance, is invented precisely as a tool to optimise this process.The presentation will use projects and writings developed in France from Sebastiano Serlio to Charles Briseux, the Grands Ensembles, and Lacaton and Vassal to retrace the way domestic space has been choreographed first as a mechanism to separate production and reproduction, and later as a disciplinary microcosm of which the housewife is both victim and villain. Such a critique is all the more urgent today as the last decades have seen the ambiguous blurring of reproductive labour into the ungendered, micro-entrepreneurial field of ‘affective labour’. It is perhaps in such a conjuncture that architecture should claim the responsibility it refused to assume before, and rethink housing within and against the realm of labour.\n12.20-13.00 Round table discussion\n13.00 – 13.40 Lunch Break\n14.00-14.40 Fabrizio Ballabio (Architectural Association, AYR)The Palace, the Pulpit and the Plant.

Commissioned by Charles of Bourbon in 1749 to address the unsettling threat that mendicity represented to both the spiritual and economic integrity of the newly formed kingdom, the project of the Albergo inscribes itself within that moment in modern history in which labour understood as ‘the condition of human life’ came to be an increasingly architectural matter.

        "detail": "We must start speaking about workers again, with programmes and projects that concern them directly, existentially.Mario Tronti, ‘Politics at Work’, 2008\nIn her book The Human Condition, Hannah Arendt distinguishes labour from work. While work is the production of things that may be more enduring than the life of its producer (like a pot or a poem), labour is the sheer unending business of life reproduction: cooking, cleaning, giving birth, raising kids, taking care of the household. According to Arendt, labour is merely a performative activity confined within the space of the house that does not leave anything material behind. With the rise of industrialisation and the increasing division of labour, the distinction between labour and work does not exist anymore and the subjectivity of animal laborans becomes the fundamental datum of modern society. Within modernity labour no longer addresses a specific sphere of the human condition but the totality of life, since under capitalism it is life as bios that is put to work and made productive. As Karl Marx wrote in a crucial passage of Das Kapital ‘labour power is the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in the physical form, the living personality, of a human being’. This means that what is at stake in the concept of labour is not the production of things, but the production of the most crucial commodity within a capitalistic economy: subjectivity. Production of subjectivity becomes the fundamental goal of a capitalistic economy.In this sense it is impossible to define the modern city and its architecture without understanding it through the lens of labour. And yet until today, with very few notable exceptions, very little has been written on the relationship between labour and architecture. While issues such as public space, politics, capitalism, neoliberalism and the commodification of the built environment are widely discussed, labour has rarely been confronted by the culture of architecture. The reason for this lack of discussion may be the ubiquity of labour itself as both spatial and social condition of our life. The symposium gathers for the first time a group of researchers who will attempt to read the relationship between labour and architecture in different contexts, from the intimacy of domestic space to the abstraction of post-industrial forms of production, to the role of the architect as producer. Rather than offering a comprehensive historical mapping, the symposium will offer critical insights towards a new understanding of architecture through the concept of labour.\n - Pier Vittorio Aureli \nProgramme:\n10.20 – 11.00Pier Vittorio Aureli (Architectural Association, Dogma, The City as a Project)Labour and Architecture: Notes in the Form of an IntroductionThis paper will tentatively define a relationship between labour and architecture in which labour is not simply the ‘content’ of architecture, but the condition within which both architectural form and architecture as profession have been historically structured. With the rise of labour as both the driving economic force and the source of political conflicts within the city, architecture becomes an assemblage of elements whose goal is no longer to represent power, but to effect power by framing, enabling, eliciting, making accessible or excluding. Moreover it is precisely by confronting the conflictual ethos of the labour force that architecture as specialised profession was born as a way to politically sabotage the guilds’ influence on the city government. Departing from Marx and Hannah Arendt’s definition of the category of labour, I will discuss exemplary case studies in which architecture both as labouring process and as built or designed form reflects both the organisation of productive and reproductive labour and the conflicts this organisation has triggered within the history of capitalism. As coda to my intervention I will introduce the contributions to the symposium as attempts to ponder the condition of labour from the factory to the home, from the construction industry to the organisation of one’s own life.\n11.00 – 11.40Francesco Marullo (Rotterdam Academy of Architecture, Behemoth Press, The City as a Project)The Measure of Emptiness: Notes on the Architecture of the Factory and the Logistic OrderThe factory could be defined as the very first architecture of the ‘whole’. More than a building, it embodies a complex system of spatial and labour relations extending far beyond the limits of its enclosure. The factory is able to convey the wide reality of production in all its distinct phases into a present and tangible form, from the extraction of materials kilometres away to the assembling of products and their final distribution across foreign lands.Its architecture is entirely derived from the necessities of production rather than from formal composition: the very notion of plan in the factory is replaced by a purely technical scheme – or layout – organising the logistic chain of operations and combining spaces with movements for an efficient management of workers and machinery. Yet, the logistic order of the factory did not only pertain to manufacture, but gradually penetrated every field of production – from heavy industry to domestic architecture, from office buildings to universities – transforming assembly lines into ‘think-belts’, smoothing functional and sequential arrangements into open spaces and flexible plans, disguising coercion as neutral free competition or cooperation.This short presentation will go through a series of plans, investigating old and present day ‘factories’, their forms of exploitation and subjection of labour-power vis-à-vis the unavoidable genericness of the architecture of production.\n11.40 – 12.20Maria S Giudici (Architectural Association, Black Square, The City as a Project)Familles, je vous hais!

If the 1970s were defined by Postmodernism and the 1980s by Deconstruction, how do we characterise the architecture of the 1990s to the present? Some built forms transmit affects of curvilinearity, others of crystallinity; some transmit multiplicity, others unity; some transmit cellularity, others openness; some transmit dematerialisation, others weight. Does this immense diversity reflect a lack of common purpose? In the third volume in Moussavi’s ‘Function’ series, The Function of Style, Farshid Moussavi argues that this diversity should not be mistaken for an eclecticism that is driven by external forces.\nFarshid Moussavi RA RIBA is an architect, principal of Farshid Moussavi Architecture (FMA) and Professor in Practice of Architecture at Harvard University Graduate School of Design.

        "detail": "Gregor Schneider is a pioneer of built art rooms and one of the most important German artists of his generation. Since 1985 Schneider has been working on the house on Unterheydener Straße in Mönchengladbach-Rheydt. He replicated existing rooms by building rooms in their entirety within other rooms. These double rooms are not visible as rooms within rooms to the viewer. Using machinery he also moves elements of the rooms out of sight. This results in hollows and inter- spaces. Some rooms become inaccessible, because they are hidden behind walls and some have been isolated using con- crete, plumbing, insulation or sound absorbing materials. Different times of day have also been simulated.\nIn 2001, he was awarded the Golden Lion at the Venice Biennale for his work Totes Haus u r exhibited at the German Pavilion.\nThere has been much controversy around his ideas for a dying room. Death and dying are an important part of his work and visitors are thrown back on themselves, confronted with their own fears.\nGregor Schneider will speak about his artistic vision of a Gesamtkunstwerk.\nBio: From 1999 to 2003, he was guest professor at several art schools including De Ateliers in Amsterdam, the Academy of Fine Arts Hamburg and the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, Copenhagen. He has been nominated professor of sculpture at the University of Art Berlin in 2009 and since 2012 at the Akademie of fine art Munich. He is a member of the North Rhine-Westphalian Academy of Sciences, Humanities and the Arts.\nImage: u r 19, LIEBESLAUBE, 1995 @Gregor Schneider/VG Bild-Kunst Bonn\nThis lecture is part of the Term 1 lecture series Art and Architecture: rooms, buildings, peninsulas; organised by Parveen Adams.

The first site - Memory Wound – a 3 1/2 metre wide slit in Sorbraten Peninsula, is now under production and to be opened July 22, 2016.\nDahlberg studied architecture at the Faculty of Engineering, LTH at Lund (1993-1995) and art at Malmø Art Academy (1995-2000). He has exhibited at a number of large galleries and institutions across the world, including the Neue Kunsthalle St Gallen, the Santa Barbara Museum of Art and Moderna Museet in Stockholm.

Their work has been included in the Liverpool (2012), Singapore (2011), Moscow (2011, 2007), Gwangju (2002), São Paulo (2002), Istanbul (2013, 2001), and Berlin (1998) biennials, and in 2009 they received a special mention for their exhibition “The Collectors” in the Nordic and Danish Pavilions at the 53rd Venice Biennale. Amongst their most well known works are “Prada Marfa” (2005) – a full scale replica of a Prada boutique in the middle of the Texan desert, and “Short Cut” (2003) – a car and a caravan breaking through the ground which was first shown in Milan and now resides in the collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago.\nElmgreen & Dragset’s winning Fourth Plinth Commission “Powerless Structures, Fig. 101” – depicting a child astride his rocking horse – was on view in 2012–2013 in Trafalgar Square, London and in 2013 they curated an extensive public art program in Munich entitled “A Space Called Public / Hoffentlich Öffentlich”. Their exhibition series “Biography” took place in 2014-2105 at the Astrup Fearnley Museet, Oslo and the SMK – National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen.\nImage: Installation (detail).

        "detail": "This lecture will give an overview of the concept and practice of territory. While the complicated and contested as- pects of territorial disputes are well known, territory also requires theoretical interrogation in order to grasp how it has been understood and practiced in different times and places.\nTerritory is a political and geographical notion, of course, but can only be adequately understood if we understand its implications in a range of registers, including economic, strategic, legal, and technical ones. Territory can be un- derstood, following Foucault, as a political technology – not simply as a container or site of political struggle, but as a contested political process.\nThe particular focus of this talk will be on the physical, material nature of territory. It will think about the relation of territory to terrain, which is a geo-strategic question, an important concept in both physical and military geography. Terrain is important because it combines materiality, strategy and the need to go beyond a narrow, two-dimensional sense of the cartographic imagination. Instead, terrain forces us to account for the complexity of height and depth, the question of volume. Terrain also makes possible, or constrains, various military-strategic projects.\nAll attempts at fixing and defending territorial boundaries are complicated by dynamic features of the Earth, includ- ing rivers, oceans, polar-regions, glaciers, airspace and the sub-surface, both the sub-soil and the sub-marine. These questions are crucial for a political-legal theory of territory more generally. Essentially the key question is: how can theories of territory better account for the complexities of the geophysical and the built environment?\nBio: Stuart Elden is Professor of Political Theory and Geography at University of Warwick and Monash-Warwick Professor at Monash University.

She was introduced to the world of design and shortly after, in 1981, became a founding member of the iconic postmodern design movement Memphis. From 1981 to 1987 she didn’t stop drawing. Every day she would draw a whole new modern world, from very small items like jewelry to entire cities. This world only existed in her head but would eventually be developed into real pieces for the Memphis exhibitions.\nThis unique book is the first and definitive compilation of all the unpublished drawings from those years, which had been sitting in the drawers of Nathalie’s studio for over 30 years. Organized by the smallest objects to the biggest and divided into chapters, each with a text by Nathalie, it has been carefully edited and designed by Apartamento magazine’s co-founder Omar Sosa together with Nathalie Du Pasquier.\nDon’t Take These Drawings Seriously is an excellent reference for future generations and a welcome document of an important period in modern design.\nFor this lecture, Nathalie Du Pasquier will present the book as a starting point for a presentation of the work in a wider sense. The work in the book, as the title suggests, is about the 80’s. In 1987 as the Memphis group was dissolving Du Pasquier decided to start painting and stopped working as a designer. Over almost 30 years her work has evolved but kept itself focused around objects and space. She paints, she draws and she builds wooden constructions. Apart from some images of patterns which are the things she has been known for, Du Pasquier would like to show what she has been doing since 1987.\nNathalie Du Pasquier was born in Bordeaux (France) in 1957 and has lived in Milan since 1979. She worked as a designer until 1986 and was a founding member of The design group Memphis. During that time she designed numerous “decorated surfaces”: textiles, carpets and some furniture and objects. In 1987 painting became her main activity.\nOmar Sosais an art director, publisher and graphic designer. In 2008 together with his business partnerS Nacho Alegre and Marco Velardi, Omar founded the magazine Apartamento. Two years later he went on to win the prestigious Yellow Pencil Award and Apartamento was awarded the best complete magazine of 2010 by the Designers and Art Directors Association (UK). Since 2010 Omar lives between Barcelona and Milan working for his own clients and focusing on the art direction of the Corriere de la Sera design magazine, Casamica.",

This talk examines their intense correspondence around the specification of proprietary products – from paints to boilers and electric clocks – and the enormous escalation in the manufacturing and marketing of building products during the interwar period. It argues that this is the moment that the architect becomes ‘shopper’ on behalf of the client and as one journalist put it at the time a ‘synthesist’ in ‘the fellowship of art, science and industry’. Behind and alongside the polemics of modernism is a transformation of the architect’s relationship to industry that goes beyond issues of aesthetics or even the management of work on site, to give them a new role in the expansion of manufacture.\nDr Katie Lloyd Thomas is Lecturer in Architecture at Newcastle University where she co-directs ARC, the Architecture Research Collaborative, and is an editor of the international journal arq. Her research is concerned with materiality in architecture and with feminist practice and theory. Her monograph Preliminary Operations: Material theory and the architectural specification is in preparation and a new anthology Industries of Architecture is forthcoming (Routledge, 2015).\nThese talks (hosted by AA Membership) are being held as part of a wider series, leading up to the centenary of women at the Architectural Association in 2017. This series, organised by AA XX 100 with the collaboration of the Library, Photo Library and Archives, will feature academics who examine different periods of Architectural Association history, focusing on architects and tutors who helped shape architectural practice and profession globally. One of the talks on the immediate postwar period will show how students activism influenced the ethos of the school. The lectures will also highlight the AA’s collections and there will be displays of unique historic material from the AA Collections at each talk.",

        "detail": "Jane Drew was one of the most prolific, international architects of the 20th Century. She practiced from the mid 1930s until the 1980s, spending a considerable portion of that time in practice with her husband, Edwin Maxwell Fry. She was very much a leader and driving force in the practice, always retaining her own independence and developing a highly collaborative approach to design that was most unusual at the time. \nThis lecture will take us on a journey of Drew’s major works starting in the UK, but focusing on her works in the Middle East, West Africa and India, as well as discussing her influences, collaborators and literary works. Drew’s work in Chandigarh is particularly important and we will consider her housing, schools and health projects in the city that informed the creation of the Department of Tropical Architecture with Otto Koenigsberger. Drew has sometimes been derided as a ‘poor designer’, she was also sometimes considered a divisive figure, but this lecture will challenge these premises that were surely rooted in the prejudices of the time.\nIain Jackson is a senior lecturer in architecture at the Liverpool School of Architecture. He is the B.A. Director of Studies and his research is concerned with transnational architecture, in particular British architects working in colonial and post-colonial settings. He has recently finished a Leverhulme funded research project investigating the significance of Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew and written a monograph (coauthored with Dr. Jessica Holland) on this work, published by Ashgate.\nThese talks (hosted by AA Membership) are being held as part of a wider series, leading up to the centenary of women at the Architectural Association in 2017. This series, organised by AA XX 100 with the collaboration of the Library, Photo Library and Archives, will feature academics who examine different periods of Architectural Association history, focusing on architects and tutors who helped shape architectural practice and profession globally. One of the talks on the immediate postwar period will show how students activism influenced the ethos of the school. The lectures will also highlight the AA’s collections and there will be displays of unique historic material from the AA Collections at each talk.",

        "detail": "Organised with the support of the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts\nThe conference will celebrate and inquire into the career of one the AA’s first female students. It aims at re-establishing the legacy of the largely unknown Jaqueline Tyrwhitt (1905-1983), a key figure in the development of 20th century modern architecture and planning, with collaborations ranging from Sigfried Giedion, Constantinos Doxiadis to Buckminster Fuller and Marshall McLuhan, and at re-invigorating the debate on contemporary forms of planning and international cooperation.\nAt the centre of a vast series of major modern architectural innovations was a woman largely unacknowledged, whose work has contributed in reshaping the ways we think the world. Jaqueline Tyrwhitt was at the focus of innovative trajectories that linked modern architecture and urbanism to new technologies of vision and integrated spatial planning, international cooperations and new concepts of cohabitation around the entire planet. Tyrwhitt’s work is for the major part invisible: at the side of Sigfried Giedion for his American works, behind the scenes of the CIAM conferences, next to Constantinos Doxiadis for the Delos Symposion and the Ekistics research, she organised, structured, built up and constantly innovated a new way of thinking the ideals of the modern city.\nTyrwhitt was at the heart of the major architectural experiences of the 20th century, playing a key role in setting up, organising and forming a new culture of modern planning, international cooperation and innovative approaches to technology and government, yet Jaqueline Tyrwhitt remains a largely unacknowledged figure. From her studies at the Architectural Association, and her work on Patrick Geddes’ planning principles, to her collaboration with Sigfried Giedion on all his major English books, to the work for CIAM, UNESCO, the United Nations, and the further development of spatial strategies and planning principles; from her work at the side of Constantinos Doxiadis and Buckminster Fuller to her thoughts on integrated spatial analysis and multi-layered cartography, the work of Jaqueline Tyrwhitt was at the forefront of multiple strands of architectural innovation. Yet she was largely invisible, and her experience is rarely mentioned, if not rapidly in bibliographical notes.\nThe symposium brings together major thinkers and practitioners from the fields that Tyrwhitt has helped to form, investigating not only the heritage of her incredible career, but also re-invigorating some of the debates that marked her life. What does it mean to think of planning today? What are the scales and modes of intervention? How does architecture conceptualise its relation to other form-generating processes? What is it to think about architecture globally?\nSchedule\nAA Think Tank roundtable event, moderated by John Palmesino\nIntroduction\nKeynote Ellen Shoshkes: Transnational life An overview of the remarkable transnational life and work of Jaqueline Tyrwhitt offers a new perspective on well-known events in mid-twentieth century architecture and planning, as well as current debates on ecological urbanism and the inter-connection between global perspectives, regional planning and local activism.\nProposition Keller Easterling: Being MinorJaqueline Tyrwhitt keeps company with several other \"minor\" texts like Benton MacKaye who are obscured or relegated to footnotes in a post World War II period of institutional consensus building. Yet, from a position in the wings, they persistently inform other registers of form-making.\nProposition Irit Rogoff: Bad Judgement The encounter with Jaqueline Tyrwhitt raises questions regarding the exercise of judgment within a Modernist paradigm. Does the Modernist ethos actually allows for the exercise of judgment, of differentiation, of withdrawal? Or does the compulsion to relentlessly move forward and ‘improve’ override it. Can Foucault’s understanding of technology as ‘a set of structured forms of action by which we also inevitably exercise power over ourselves’ – counter Modernisms investment in ‘Neotechnics’ ?\nProposition Gediminas and Nomeda Urbonas: artistic research at the techno-social moment Informed by the cybernetic discourse of self-regulation, feedback loops and homeostasis, the advocates of art and technology such as fellows at MIT’s Center for Advanced Visual Studies saw the potential for artists to collaborate with scientists and engineers to create what they called “ecological feedback machines that sense our danger and work toward resolving the problem of man’s relations with his surroundings” (G.Kepes). This presentation will discuss experiments in art and technology as they relate to artistic research and knowledge production within histories of techno-social moment at MIT. Taking point of departure in the environmental art movement at MIT in the late 60s, and their interest in systems theory, and the role of new technologies in mitigation of the hazards of industrialization, this presentation will inquire notion of citizenship and public space in search of counter narratives.\nProposition Territorial Agency: Shifting groundsArraying the planet through remote sensing, through continuous enquiry into the very possibility of making observation global, the International is a space where multiplicities of actors are re-organised and their territories undone, eroded, shifted and recomposed. The Anthropocene disposes a multiplicity of territories, recomposes their agencies and makes them available, through the kaleidoscope of technological vision, for controversies and radical negotiations, where no overarching rationality is practicable. The backgrounds from where Tyrwhitt operated are now acting on us.\nSpeakers\nEllen Shoshkes is an urban planner and designer based in Portland, Oregon, where she is on the faculty of the Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning at Portland State University. She has written widely in academic and professional journals on housing, community development, and topics in the history of urban planning and design. She holds a Ph.D. in Urban Planning from Rutgers University and a Master of Architecture from MIT. Her book, Jaqueline Tyrwhitt: A Transnational Life in Urban Planning and Design, was published by Ashgate in 2013. She also selected and wrote the Introduction to Society and Environment: A Historical Review, a collection of four texts by Tyrwhitt forthcoming from Routledge in May 2015.\nKeller Easterling is an architect, writer and professor at Yale University. Her books include Enduring Innocence: Global Architecture and its Political Masquerades (MIT, 2005) and Organization Space: Landscapes, Highways and Houses in America (MIT, 1999). Her new book, Extrastatecraft: Global Infrastructure and Political Arts (Yale University Press, 2013), examines global infrastructure networks as a medium of polity.\nIrit Rogoff is a theorist, curator, and organizer who writes at the intersections of the critical, the political, and contemporary arts practices. Rogoff is a professor at Goldsmiths College, University of London, in the department of Visual Cultures, which she founded in 2002.\nUrbonas Studio, founded by Nomeda and Gediminas Urbonas is an interdisciplinary research program that advocates for the reclamation of public culture in the face of overwhelming privatization, stimulating cultural and political imagination as tools for social change. Often beginning with archival research, Urbonas Studio methodology unfolds complex participatory works investigating the urban environment, architectural developments, and cultural and technological heritage. Nomeda Urbonas is PhD fellow at the Norwegian University of Science & Technology. Gediminas Urbonas is professor at the MIT Program in Art, Culture & Technology, Cambridge, USA. They are artists and educators, born in Lithuania.\nJohn Palmesino and Ann-Sofi Rönnskog are architects and urbanists and are the founders of Territorial Agency, an independent organization that promotes and works for sustainable territorial transformations, combining analysis, contemporary architecture and urbanism, advocacy and action. Their work focuses on the transformations of the relation between polities and space. They are co-authors of the ‘Anthropocene Observatory’. They are directors of AA ThinkTank, AA Taiwan Project and they convene AA Diploma Unit 4. John is researching the spatial consequences of neutrality for his PhD. Ann-Sofi is investigating remote sensing and territorial change in the North for her PhD.\nFormatThe session will take the format of a large round table, where all speakers are present to discuss at any moment. The keynote by Ellen Shoshkes will highlight the main elements of Tyrwhitt’s career, followed by propositions that outline her work in connection to current discourses on contemporary architecture, urbanism and planning at a global scale. The public is seated in the room around the speakers. The symposium will be recorded and made available online. The contributions will be collected and edited for a subsequent publication.\nTwo SymposiaThe London conference is the first of two symposia, one on each side of the Atlantic, which trace the unprecedented trajectory of Jaqueline Tyrwhitt. The two symposia aim at closing a gap in the understanding of the development of modern architecture and urbanism, bringing new light to the work of Tyrwhitt and reconnecting debates of contemporary architecture and urbanism with new and larger audiences.The first symposium takes place in March 2015 at the Architectural Association in London, and will mark the first major public event of the new AA Think Tank. A second symposium will take place in autumn 2015 in Chicago in the ambit of the first Chicago Architecture Biennial. It will bring together major experts in the development of CIAM, Ekistics, GIS and earth observation. It will focus on contemporary aspects of global architecture, development and infrastructures.\nRecommended readingEllen Shoshkes: Jaqueline Tyrwhitt: A TransnationalLife in Urban Planning and Design, Ashgate 2013\nAA Think TankIn 2013 the AA School and public program appointed Ann-Sofi Rönnskog and John Palmesino as the directors of a new AA Think Tank, a research centre to think about the territories of the 21st Century. The AA Think Tank connects the research, teaching and learning at the AA with its Public Programme, it links real world issues with the architecture intelligence developed within the school.\nPlan the Planet Poster\nPlan the Planet Symposium Schedule\nImage: Jaqueline Tyrwhitt with Jawaharlal Nehru, Prime Minister of India as he visited the “model village” built for a UN Regional Seminar on Housing Improvement, New Delhi, 1954.

Unfinished time started in the past and continues into the present. There is no quarantine period between historical facts and contemporary truth. Architecture is a form of presence, yet its history always plays a key role in both its production and interpretation. At best its history is told in\nthe present perfect tense by means of projective speculation to establish a strong, yet individual, and ad hoc connection between then and now. \nAlex is looking for such strong – sometimes constructed – genealogical, idea-based, and conceptual connections between the past and the present by talking about a couple of his projects addressing collective form through the attempt of an alternative historical approach. Among them the project of the German Pavilion at the 14. International Architecture Biennale in Venice, his recently published book The Western Town – A Theory of Aggregation, and his work on Urban Rules. \nAlex Lehnerer, an architect and urban designer, currently holds a position as assistant professor at ETH Zurich in Switzerland. Prior to that he was based in Chicago, where he was a professor at the University of Illinois, School of Architecture. He received his PhD from ETH Zurich and his MArch from the University of California in Los Angeles (UCLA). Together with his partner Savvas Ciriacidis he is leading the Zurich based architecture practice CIRIACIDISLEHNERER. In 2014, the two were the general commissioners of the German pavilion at the 14.

In conversation, architects, educators and urbanists, Liza Fior of muf and Zaida Muxi Martinez of Col-lectiu Punt 6, bring their experience to bear, comparing British and Spanish practices and exploring issues, including public space, urban strategies and cultural innovation. Zaida will highlight the work the Col-lectiu Punt 6, a collective of women who research and work for more equal and inclusive cities. The boundary of art and architecture, public and private, architecture and space, which muf traverses through their (originally) all-women office will be represented by their latest projects. This conversation is part of the AA XX 100 lecture series.\nLeading up to the centenary of women at the Architectural Association in 2017, over the next three years, a series of lectures, organised by AA XX 100, will draw different generations, disciplines and voices into the AA conversation. Through presentations, dialogue and debate, the series will highlight and challenge the concerns and values of the profession from a theorised gendered perspective which recognises the inclusive and collaborative nature of architecture, while serving as a catalyst for bigger ideas and a wider discussion of women in architecture. The series will feature prominent practitioners from contemporary global architecture and urbanism, as well as articulate the substantial contribution that AA women have made in the last 100 years, creating engaging conversations between past and present, men and women, staff and students. \nZaida Muxi Martinez is an architect by the University of Buenos Aires and obtained her PhD from the School of Architecture of the University of Seville (2002). She is professor of Urban Planning at the School of Architecture of Barcelona (ETSAB) at the Polytechnic University of Barcelona since 2003, where she was deputy director from 2009 to 2012. She is currently co-director with Josep Maria Montaner of the Master of the XXIst century Sustainable Housing Lab since 2004 (http://www.laboratoriovivienda21.com/blog/). She is expert in urban planning, architecture and gender, and a member of Col·lectiu Punt 6, a group of women that advocate for and conduct research on gender inclusive planning (http://punt6.wordpress.com ). In January 2014 she has begun to work as expert in public space, safety and gender for Palmira government. Colombia.\nLiza Fior studied architecture - an education which continued when she taught at the AA , met and collaborated with Katherine Clarke artist (Artist partner, muf) and was conveniently (for muf) sacked when a new head of school arrived who wanted more practitioners in the school. muf were winners of the  European Prize for Public Space ,authored of the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale  and nominated for the Mies Van de Rohe Prize and the Swiss Prize for Architecture  for projects with limited budgets and briefs enriched by the unsolicited research which was and continues to be, entwined into every project. These range from urban design, critical research,  landscapes and buildings and the relationship between them —a continual dialogue between detail and strategy. Co-author of, “This is What We Do: a muf manual” (London: 2001) muf were awarded a Grahame Foundation grant for the next iteration .

        "detail": "When describing their research programme for sending out in space by 2020 the world’s first 3D printed satellite, scientists from the European Space Agency pointed out that \"in the world of materials it’s the mixing of [...] different chemical elements that is vital [...]: we hardly use pure metals but we do use compounds, alloys and composites; the actual number of combinations and ratios of mixing elements is infinite\" (ESA, 2014). Being \"closer to alchemy than architectural tectonics [...] multi-materiality is the holy grail of materials scientists\" (Wiscombe, 2012), while in architecture initial research in the field of multi-material design is only beginning to become evident, albeit in a dispersed manner.\nThe symposium will bring together architects, designers, scientists, material researchers, theorists and futurists in order to discuss what this game-changing multi-material shift will bring about for architecture. The elimination of centuries- old messy building processes, the convergence of disciplines, radical energy, resource and material savings, the re- emergence of theories of continuity and material agency, the rethinking of current design methodologies and an ensuing aesthetic of gradients as opposed to sharp boundaries, are some of the themes to be discussed in the event.\nSchedule\n Morning Session (10.00- 13.00) •10.00- Welcome & Intro (Kostas Grigoriadis) •10.10- Stefan Bassing (Bartlett GAD RC6, Zaha Hadid Architects) •10.30- Michael Herrmann (Institute for Lightweight Structures and Conceptual Design, University of Stuttgart) •10.50- Mostafa El Sayed/Vishu Bhooshan (CODE Group, Zaha Hadid Architects) •11.10- Alexandros Tsamis (Universidad Adolfo Ibañez) •11.40- Francis Bitonti (Francis Bitonti Studio) •12.20- Discussion (Led by Roberto Bottazzi)\nAfternoon Session (14.30- 18.00)•14.30- Daniel Richards/Martyn Amos (Dalton Research Institute, Manchester Metropolitan University) •14.50- André Studart (Department of Complex Materials, ETH Zürich) •15.10- Andy Payne/Panagiotis Michalatos (Lift Architects/Harvard GSD)•Break•16.10- Lambros Malafouris (Institute of Archaeology, University of Oxford) •16.40- Rachel Armstrong (School of Architecture, Landscape & Planning, University of Newcastle) •17.20- Discussion (Led by Theodore Spyropoulos)\nSpeakers\nMartyn Amos is Professor of Novel Computation at Manchester Metropolitan University.

In very different guises, architects, designers and artists have long explored this relationship and sought to define its terms, query the respective roles and turn the different elements to their own advantage, whereas current architects design and work eagerly with artists and designers. Recently too, it has been argued that architecture is not an art, and design should not be confused with art. In conversation, this tangled but important relationship and its implications will be addressed, while Sophie will trace its impact on her own work, which began in fashion design. This conversation is part of the AA XX 100 lecture series.\nLeading up to the centenary of women at the Architectural Association in 2017, over the next three years, a series of lectures, organised by AA XX 100, will draw different generations, disciplines and voices into the AA conversation. Through presentations, dialogue and debate, the series will highlight and challenge the concerns and values of the profession from a theorised gendered perspective which recognises the inclusive and collaborative nature of architecture, while serving as a catalyst for bigger ideas and a wider discussion of women in architecture.

She is also a columnist for Frieze magazine, and the author of the critically acclaimed book “Hello World: Where Design Meets Life”, which explores design’s influence on our lives: past, present and future. Alice is a trustee of the Whitechapel Gallery and the contemporary dance group Michael Clark Company, as well as chair of trustees at the Chisenhale Gallery in London. She was awarded an OBE in 2014 for services to design and the arts. \nSophie Hicks formed Sophie Hicks Architects in 1990 whilst studying at the Architectural Association in London. Prior to this Sophie worked as a Fashion Editor for British Vogue and stylist for Azzedine Alaia. The practice started by designing private houses and subsequently developed architectural identity for fashion brands. Sophie Hicks Architects has a long-standing involvement with the art world and has designed a number of museum exhibitions, reflecting Sophie’s personal interest in art. These include “Sensation, Young British Artists from the Saatchi Collection” and “Picasso, Painter and Sculptor in Clay” at the Royal Academy in London.

The Architectural Association School of Architecture is joining in the debate and as part of its public programme, is holding a series of events next spring to bring together architects, politicians, planners, developers and commentators to debate the key questions. The series will culminate in an open jury when students of the AA will share their ideas with an audience comprising speakers, academics, members and fellow students. The open jury will enable students to present their work to the participants in this series, and will be followed by a closing session which will bring together the key outcomes of the debates.\nMartyn Evans is the Creative Director at Cathedral Group, a specialist mixed-use property developer based in an 18th Century listed church in SE1. Cathedral’s £2.5bn development pipeline includes a number of large mixed-use public private partnership schemes in London and the South East, regenerating town centres and building new public facilities funded by private speculative development. Regeneration schemes include the former EMI/HMV factory complex in Hayes, West London, 19 acres of the Greenwich Peninsula and The Movement, a mixed use site next to the DLR station in Greenwich, South East London. In May 2014 cathedral was acquired by Development Securities PLC, a joint venture partner for some time. Before joining the Cathedral board in 2011, Martyn ran a successful branding and communications consultancy, working in the property, regeneration and urban design sectors for, among others, CABE, The Design Council and Design for London with a particular focus on regeneration through creative industry and cultural engagement. \n\nImage: Robin Hood Gardens-London, http://photolibrary.aaschool.ac.uk\n\n\n",

This presentation will discuss the design possibilities borne out biomimicry and synthetic biology, and question how close our new materials are to those found in biology.\nThe Embedded Intelligence Lecture Series aims to interrogate three main lines of inquiry -- material systems, natural systems, and machinic systems -- which comprise the notion of Embedded Intelligence in architecture and design. Each presenter will deliver a lecture built around a series of curated questions pertaining to the subject matter, streamed live on Google Hangouts. The series ends in a roundtable discussion with the curators, in person at the AA and on air around the world, investigating a series of prototypical case studies designed through the model of Embedded Intelligence. \nDavid Benjamin is an architect and professor whose work unites synthetic biology with architecture in the creation of dynamic, living structures. His work also focuses on repurposing already-existing materials and structures in ways that subvert their original purpose and redirect them toward sustainability. David teaches at the Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, where he formed the Living Architecture Lab, which experiments with new systems and adaptive technologies through open source, collaborative, hands-on design. He is co-founder of The Living, a firm dedicated to creating architecture that is both interactive and responsive to environmental conditions. His innovations include Living Light, a permanent, illuminated pavilion in Seoul that visually reports changes in air quality, and Amphibious Architecture, a floating installation in New York’s East River that enabled participants to communicate with fish and learn about water pollution. \n\n ",

Using modified or self-built high-tech digital tools and cameras that “see” what the human eye can not see and the human nature rarely perceives, he has created mesmerizing representations of speeding subway trains and of flows of people on busy sidewalks.\nMagyar depicts the synergies of man and the city, and embraces the city as home to both man and technology. With each of his series, he observes time flowing by and life pulsating in front of his eyes. In his works, he scrutinizes the transience of life and man’s inherent urge to leave some trace behind. Magyar is keen on adopting and reinventing contemporary devices like industrial machine-vision cameras to be able to produce his unique cityscapes. \nBorn and raised in Hungary and now based in Berlin, he travels the world extracting his images from the simple, ever-changing nature of daily urban life. “I am just an observer with a camera and a scanner”, he says. \nHis works have been exhibited in various solo and group shows internationally including Museum of Fine Arts Houston, the Graduate School of Design Harvard University, Julie Saul Gallery and the Transformer Station in the USA, Helsinki Photography Biennial in Finland, ERES-Foundation and BSA exhibitions in Germany, Vasarely Foundation in France, the Ethnographic Museum Budapest and Faur Zsofi Gallery in Hungary, Rhubarb Rhubarb in the UK and SoSo Gallery in South Korea.

The home, once a site of architectural investigation, experiment, and potential social change, is being transformed into a commodity—a “bitcoin for oligarchs” in the words of Bruce Sterling. The domestic interior registers a new social paradigm whereby postwar welfare has given way to neoliberal visions of sharing. Privacy, comfort, and stability are rapidly becoming a thing of the past.\nHow has this shift occurred, and what does it entail?

The symposium will explore the theoretical and design-oriented implications of computation in PhD design research at various scales. In recent decades, the role of computation in architectural research has had a profound impact in terms of empowering designers to breach into other fields including various scientific domains, infusing innovative ideas into design. As a result, algorithmic design has developed towards an interdisciplinary domain that integrates different mathematical and biological algorithms into architectural cultures. Computational design has established itself as a fundamental aspect of critical design thinking, including the simulation of physical and mathematical phenomena and their evolution as basis for information-based design approaches.\nAs such, while techniques and methods which associate computation and design research in novel ways are discussed, the effects of new design paradigms brought forward by computation on PhD research will be questioned. Over a three-session, all-day event, the symposium will be set up to discuss the current ongoing research, incorporating the interdisciplinary domains of biology, mathematics, artificial intelligence, urbanism, and other related fields.

As a practice, their projects span from macro-scaled urban strategies and infrastructure studies, such as the redesign of area of Camden's West End in which the AA sits (between Tottenham Court Road,  Gower Street, Warren Street and Shaftesbury Avenue) though to highly acclaimed individual crafted buildings which celebrate the act of making and materiality within architecture, such as Alex Monroe’s Studio in Snowsfields, London or their new Covert House – an uncompromisingly radical concrete cottage within a historic conservation area. These projects have evolved through a unique design methodology that deploys tactics developed through 15 years of parallel research in academia and on the ground, and which have been widely recognised as ground-breaking.\nThe lecture will focus on research carried out within the Studio, and as part of Deborah Saunt’s recently PhD at RMIT Europe, revealing not only the qualities and preoccupations found within the projects which engage with nature and contemporary conditions but also how architects must invariably demonstrate agency within the practice of architecture so that they insert themselves into the project, create impulses that propel the progress of design forward.\nDSDHA is a design and research studio based in London, whose works spans across the boundaries between architecture, landscape and urbanism. DSDHA is best known for its innovative approach to urbanism, sustainability and public engagement. Their projects have been recognised with 12 RIBA Awards in the last decade, and they have twice been nominated for the European Uniion Mies Van Der Rohe Prize for Contemporary Architecture.\nRecent projects range from a gateway building for London's Olympic Village, a flagship store in the West End and a new studio for writer and artist Edmund de Waal. In addition, DSDHA has been involved in significant urban design proposals including the redesign of Tottenham Court Road in London's West End, improvements to the public realm between The Albert Memorial and The Royal Albert Hall, as well as urban regeneration projects for Waterloo and Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens.\nDeborah and David Hill also lead the studio's urban research, regularly writing and broadcasting on architecture, and have taught widely including at the AA, EPFL (Lausanne), University of Cambridge, RCA and currently The Cass School of Architecture.\nhttp://www.dsdha.co.uk/\n \nImage : Edmund de Waal Studio and Gallery",

Food City investigates the reinstatement of food at the core of national and local governance -- how it can be a driver to restructure employment, education, transport, tax, health, culture, communities, and the justice system, re-evaluating how the city functions as a spatial and political entity. Global in scope, Food City first addresses the frameworks of over 25 international cities through the medium of food and how the city is governed. It then provides a case study through drawings, models, and text, exploring how a secondary infrastructure could function as a living environmental and food system operating as a sustainable stratum over the city of London. This case study raises serious questions about the priorities of our governing bodies, using architectural relationships to reframe the spaces of food consumption and production, analyzed through historical precedent, function and form. This study of the integration of food, architecture, and the development of future cities will both inspire and stimulate professionals and students in the fields of urban design and architecture. \nLondon 2014, 27x21 cm, fully illustrated, 340pp. Paperback Images : Food Parliament 1",

        "detail": "1871 was the year in which the cities of Berlin and Chicago were catapulted into a modern reality. That year the Chicago Fire inspired a building code that in combination with advances in fireproofing iron and steel frames and inventions such as Otis’s safety passenger elevator guided the construction of a new city with massive buildings that soon lined entire blocks of the downtown grid. On the other side of the Atlantic, Berlin’s emergence as the capital of the Second German Empire shifted the political, economic, and cultural landscape of Germany and Europe and established the city as a metropolis. In the wake of these developments, a trans-Atlantic exchange between the two cities began to reconsider each city’s option towards a new metropolitan condition. Chicago became the model through which Berlin was able to understand its own rapid urbanization during the late nineteenth century and, ultimately, re-conceiving itself as a space of possibilities for the invention of a metropolitan architecture. At the same time, German Sociologists (such as Werner Sombart, Ferdinand Tönnies, and Max Weber) visited Chicago, detected the purest representation of modern urbanization, and helped architects (such as Root John Wellborn Root and Louis H. Sullivan) to comprehend the unique conditions of what they saw as “prototypical American city and ur metropolis.”Alexander Eisenschmidt is a designer, theorist, and Assistant Professor of Architecture at the University of Illinois at Chicago. His work investigates the productive tension between the modern city and architectural form – a topic on which he has published and lectured extensively.

A late work completed two years after his death, the museum is a resounding expression of Le Corbusier's synthesis of the arts.     A reading of the building draws out a dynamic process of form-generation, in which shadows and light are transmuted into building materials. It also highlights a deep-rooted poésie des rapports (poetry of relations), expressed in the play of light, in the harmony of proportions and in the organisation of movement around the building. The Heidi Weber Museum can be seen as the end point of a trajectory of ideas ‚ - a revolutionary work that compels the visitor to stop, to contemplate, to dream, to question and to imagine.        Naïma Jornod, MD, is a cardiovascular surgeon based in Geneva. Parallel to her medical career, she has always been interested in art. After completing a master's degree in art history she has now embarked on a PhD on the role of the drawing in the work of Le Corbusier.\nImage - Heidi Weber in front of the ground floor terrace, 1967 - Heidi Weber Museum - Center Le Corbusier",

In some cases cities seem to collect spectacular buildings as they were mere market or media products, having little regard for their context and contribution to the urban environment. The seminar draws on Davide Ponzini’s research and Michele Nastasi’s photographic work regarding European, American and Asian cities. It shows that the spectacularization of contemporary architecture is potentially inducing paradoxical and even perverse urban effects; it proposes new policy, design and visual perspectives for informing current research, debate and practice.\nDavide Ponzini received his PhD (cum laude) in Urban Planning from Politecnico di Milano, where he is currently Assistant Professor of Urban Planning.

MIES 1:1 The Golf Club Project is an unusual experiment, an architecture exhibition made up of only the 1:1 model. Curator Christiane Lange invited Belgian architect Paul Robbrecht (Robbrecht en Daem architects, Gent) to develop the model’s structure, based on the original plans. The project was completed in May 2013, on the original site in Krefeld. As an example of mature architectural language, the 1:1 model distils Mies’ concepts and can be seen as a unique object d’architecture.\nChristiane Lange who initiated and curated the project will speak about the historic and artistic background as well as the meaning and public reception of the 1:1 model. Christiane Lange holds a masters in art history and history from the Universities at Bonn. As a member of the German Research Foundation Project Catalog Raisonné of furniture and furniture design by Mies van der Rohe, she catalogues all furniture designs, realised and un-realised, by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The Project is led by Wolf Tegethoff of the Zentralinstitut fuer Kunstgeschichte, Munich, Germany. Christiane is a founding member of 'Projekt MIK e. V.' Krefeld, Germany.

Christiane’s most recent publications are Mies van der Rohe, Architecture for the silkindustrie and Mies in Krefeld, a documentary film.\nJulian Heynen will present 'Making Models – A Way of Talking About the World', specifically drawing attention to the work of Thomas Schütte as an example for how models can be used in the neighbouring field of contemporary art. Julian Heynen is a curator and writer specialising in contemporary art and currently artistic director at large of the Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf. In the 1980s and 1990s he was director of exhibitions at Haus Lange and Haus Esters, two villas designed by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe in 1927–30.\nPaul Robbrecht will present 'The Reconstruction of an Architectural Thought' discussing his approach to the source materials and how he approximated the 80 year old designs. Co-founder of Robbrecht en Daem architecten, Paul Robbrecht is currently International Fellow of the RIBA, guest professor, University of Ghent and member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts.\nWatch a film about the project.\n[image: Paul Robbercht, Christiane Lange, Julian Heynen copyright M.Dannenmann]",

The lectures are concerned firstly with how works of art, drama and literature, as well as architecture, are presented in the world. There is a zone of transition between everyday life and the art object which marks the very difference between them. At the same time, this positioning of the art work is itself artful and its means are often drawn from other arts. This zone constitutes a culturally recognised form of presentation and recognition. The consequences for artistic theory are explored.\nThe lectures (five of) will take place at 5.00pm on the following Fridays in Term 2:\nFriday 31st January\nFriday 7th February (between the Type versus Typology Symposium events)\nFriday 21st February\nFriday 28th February\nFriday 7th March",

In a design world increasingly dominated by organic and redundant forms, abstraction is likely to be one of the most unpopular concepts in the field of architectural theory. While it is a mistake to think abstraction opposes the complexities and contradictions of our world, we deny that it is the very outcome of larger historical and cultural forces. \nPier Vittorio Aureli will investigate the issue of abstraction and its relation to architectural form to propose a different interpretation of this historical phenomenon. Paraphrasing Marx, abstraction – in the form of categories such as geometry, measure, modularity and scale – was born out of ‘fire and blood’, and the historical evolution of abstract forms in architecture, such as the rise of modular design, the importance of the plan in architectural design, and the simplification of architectural form, has taken place amid political conflicts and economic turmoil. The seminar will attempt to read issues such as form and design in relation to the history of political economy, revisiting the work of numerous architects along the way, in order to uncover abstraction not as stylistic movement, but as the very essence of the modern project of architecture.\nThe series of lunchtime seminars is open to all.

In a design world increasingly dominated by organic and redundant forms, abstraction is likely to be one of the most unpopular concepts in the field of architectural theory.

Paraphrasing Marx, abstraction – in the form of categories such as geometry, measure, modularity and scale – was born out of ‘fire and blood’, and the historical evolution of abstract forms in architecture, such as the rise of modular design, the importance of the plan in architectural design, and the simplification of architectural form, has taken place amid political conflicts and economic turmoil. The seminar will attempt to read issues such as form and design in relation to the history of political economy, revisiting the work of numerous architects along the way, in order to uncover abstraction not as stylistic movement, but as the very essence of the modern project of architecture.\nThe series of lunchtime seminars is open to all.

Construction of this spectacular tower, was exceptionally complex owing to its free form, tremendous height and welter of facilities including observation decks, conference rooms, shops and cinemas. Additionally, the location required that it should be able to withstand earthquakes and typhoons.\nExisting legislation and working methods failed to satisfy a building of this size and height. The chosen methodology, which was developed while construction proceeded, can be cited as an example of how to handle new projects of this megascale. Supermodel reports at length on the project’s origins, history, design and construction as well as the work situation in China, which seems increasingly to act as an incubator for experimental architecture.\nFor this evening's lecture, Mark Hemel will introduce the project, present a short documentary about the project, and discuss the book (written by himself and Barbara Kuit), Supermodel: Making one of the world's tallest towers.\nMore about the documentary:\nReaching for the Sky (by Bert Oosterveld and Peter Franken) candidly shows the personal and professional dilemmas of young architect Mark Hemel who, together with his wife, architect Barbara Kuit, seems to achieve his highest ambition with his first big assignment. On 12 October 2013 the world premiere of “Reaching for the sky” took place during the Architecture Film Festival Rotterdam.\nMark Hemel studied at the Technical University of Delft and Architectural Association in London. He received several scholarships for research in Africa and Asia from the Netherlands Foundation for Visual Arts, Design and Architecture. From 1999–2008 he taught as Unitmaster at the Architectural Association in London and later in the post-graduate Environment and Energy programme. In 2003 he received the RIBA Bronze Medal Tutor Award. In 1998 he and Barbara Kuit founded Information Based Architecture (IBA), which they operate from Amsterdam, The Netherlands and Guangzhou, China. ",

There is one big warning about the seminar, that it is not my intention to present an idea of an abstract architecture, which I find a clumsy definition. It is not the intention to present abstraction as a style, even if it is an important clue to understand the problem of abstraction. My intention is to define abstraction as a condition, as a historical condition that can be understood as a fundamental phenomena of modernity, with impact in many spheres, including architecture. The problem is that while in other fields, especially in the arts, there have been quite profound and sometimes controversial definitions of what is abstraction (in poetry, literature, dance), in architecture is very unclear how abstraction has emerged. There is very little literature that has attempted to define the problem of abstraction and even this literature usually addresses abstraction as a style. In a time where we are submerged by complexity and redundancy of forms it is very likely to be an unpopular topic. Again, I really stress that this lectures should not be understood as a promotion of a return to abstraction. In that sense, the first session of today is an attempt to introduce this process of historicizing abstraction. Abstraction is a reflection of a fundamental problem of modernity, which is the unprecedented problem of administrating life. Perhaps because of the lack of literature mentioned it is useful to rehearse briefly the idea of abstraction within the history of painting, especially in the twentieth century. In painting, the problem of abstraction has been felt very radically, because it is precisely within the realm of painting that the polemic of abstraction became very manifest as the opposite of representation. The reason why Western art was so attached, until the twentieth century, to the problem of representation is because it has been one of the fundamental assets of Christian ideology. Christianity is actually a religion that has attempted to establish itself historically, not only in religious terms (we measure our time since the birth of Christ), and therefore representation within Christian art has always played a fundamental role. It is possible to say that the removal of representation from painting was a radical act of secularizing painting. It is a process that started not within representation or painting itself, but through the debates around aesthetic problems. Aesthetics, a science of perception, started this process of removal of the experience of pure forms, colours, supports—the material properties of art—from any content. In fact, what it is actually considered pioneering works within abstract painting, Kazimir Malevich’s famous black square, which is dated 1915, even if Malevich dated it 1913, can be considered not just a pioneering act of abstraction, but on the contrary the conclusion of a very long process, or debate that took place in the nineteenth century. There, the idea of art as a purely material activity, where form is removed from content, from ideology, took place. It is very interesting that already here we have a sort of paradox of abstraction, because Malevich presenting his black square, said that it was a realist painting, precisely because it shows the very essence of what is a painting, which is a flat surface, painted with colour. We see here a fundamental problem of abstraction, which advocates for the removal of painting or arts from the attempt to represent the real experience of the world, and at the same time abstraction is also an act of realism, because the painter shows the material properties of the object produced. What it is interesting in the narratives of abstraction in the nineteenth century is a sort of eschatological ideology. On one end, abstract painters attempted to remove abstraction form a clear reference to reality, and at the same time, abstraction was embraced by artists until the mid 1960s as a sort of salvation of art against corruption, representation, and therefore against values that had no longer legitimacy to be celebrated by painting. Ad Reinhardt was a painter that decided for the last twelve years of his life to only paint a black square (he painted forty or more), and at the same time he also produced a series of tools, like the cartoon ‘The Rescue of Art’ (1946) where he tried to explain the ethics and the morality of abstract art, in this case the salvation of art by abstract art. Abstraction was understood as a process of liberation, or redemption. The eschatological role of abstraction was questioned by some artists, precisely in the terms that Malevich saw abstraction: as a radical act of material appropriation of the world. Frank Stella did a series in the end of the 1950s in this fashion, where he banaly repeats the material constraints given, like the perimeter of the canvas in ‘The Marriage Between Reason and Squalor’ (1958). In other paintings, Stella udes titles from Nazi politics, which puts abstraction under a light that is quite equivocal. There has been a sort of resurrection of abstraction in the last fifteen years, but this time abstraction is no longer a sort of liberation from reality, on the contrary, abstract painting seems to represent our everyday reality, which is processed through images that are increasingly abstract, like the work ‘Landscape’ of the artist Flavio de Marco (2006), representing a computer desktop.\nA fundamental reference for me has been the work of Meyer Schapiro, who in 1937 wrote ‘The Nature of Abstract Art’: a seminal essay, which I consider one of the landmarks in the history of abstraction in art, and also one of the most important texts on the arts during the twentieth century. He wrote this text one year after a major exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art ‘Cubism and Abstract Art’. It is the first official celebration of avant garde art in Europe at the MoMA (when an exhibition comes to MoMA it means that a phenomena has been institutionalized). The catalogue had a text from Alfred Barr, the curator of the MoMA at that time, which introduced abstraction as the moment in which the artist finally found his proper space of activity, after centuries in which art had been spoiled by the problem of representation. Abstraction was really a kind of process in which finally the painter understood the material terms within he or she was operating. Schapiro published this text in Marxist quarterly criticising this explanation by Barr, saying that the problem of abstraction has to be seen within a much larger field, in which economy, politics play a fundamental role, so abstraction is not the natural conclusion of art, but the reflection of very specific social and cultural conditions that are reflected in the modes of perception of the social body, of which art is a fundamental clue. Schapiro is one of the first to introduce this larger framework, which for many years art historians, Barr, but famously also Clement Greenberg, had left outside the discussion of abstraction. These are my methodological roots to discuss abstraction in architecture. I will argue, paraphrasing Marx, that we will see that abstraction, rather than a sort of removal from reality, is on the contrary something firmly rooted in a process of fire and blood, meaning a real, concrete, political and social process. These phenomenon are not parallel, but part of the same process.\nI would like to define abstraction in very empirical terms, which I think is a good way to frame the problem, I will then try to open up this definition to a more social and political understanding and then I will introduce a few categories by using architectural examples that form a glossary that will be useful in the next sessions. ‘To abstract,’ comes from the latin verb trahere, which means to put something essential out of the totality of which it is part. Out of this definition, we understand that abstraction is a process that we always do in order to communicate. Abstraction means taking out, by which men tries to define generic frameworks, rather than specific solutions. This is exactly what modernity was about: an attempt to overcome specific problems in order to seek something more generic, all-inclusive. Of course, this implied a new mode of governance within the conditions of the modern city. Production in general played a fundamental role. I was also looking for a more subtle, theoretical definition, that might go beyond what we have seen until now. Perhaps one of the most interesting definitions of abstraction is the one sketched by Marx in the introduction to the ‘Grundrisse’, whose thematic is political economy, and it is the first attempt to write the Capital. Probably is one of the only books where Marx talks about his methodology of work. By explaining his methodology Marx is forced to define abstraction. As we will see, abstraction is a fundamental category in the full tradition of political economy. Marx struggles to define the importance and the relevance of abstraction in his way of thinking about political economy. In his early writings, Marx was very critical of abstraction, he identified abstraction precisely with the attempt, typical of Hegelian philosophy, to detach thinking from the concrete experience of reality. He understood that political economy is constitutionally made of abstractions. His way to define abstraction is subtle, in a way that is important for today. The method of rising from the abstract to the concrete is the only way in which thought appropriates the concrete and reproduces it as the concrete in the mind. It is an elliptical sentence, but key to the Marxian definition of abstraction. Marx does not see abstraction as the essence of something, on the contrary, the abstract is the starting point: our way of thinking. The moment I use language, and say chair, or wall, I produce an abstraction. That word represents the totality or the abstract idea of wall. In any act of thinking, in any attempt to theorize reality, abstraction is an inescapable condition, as language is a form of abstraction. So for Marx the problem is not how to go from the concrete to the abstract, but the opposite: how the abstraction helps us to define our perception and our experience of the concrete. Marx realized that after he had harshly criticised Hegel, he was going back very close to him, inasmuch as he said that thinking produces reality. But for Marx, none of them is removed: the concrete and the abstraction are two faces of the same coin. Abstraction is not understood as the origin of something, but as an act of creating a milieu of sharing. Thus, among the totality of many things, we can select something which is always a process that comes in a very rich, developed reality, which for Marx is the capitalist bourgeois society. Marx defines abstraction as a historical, social category, which can only be thought of in the moment industrial civilization has evolved, because the only way to make sense of this situation is to create abstract categories, that have a huge influence in the way concrete reality is experienced. For Marx, these terms are the ones forming the glossary of political economy: wealth, exchange, value, labour, which are fundamental for the way we theorize it. Nevertheless these abstractions are always what makes the whole system work: we cannot remove them and still theorize, as they are deeply enrooted in conflicts and in the governance of society. Marxs recognized the importance of Adam Smith, as the first one that talks about wealth in general, not mercantile wealth, agricultural wealth and so on. All the concrete aspects of political economy are predicated on this abstraction. For Marx, this condition of abstraction plays a fundamental historical role, it is not a timeless construct. Abstraction would have a profound reflection within the production of architecture, as a practice and as a design. Labour really defines modern subjectivity, in the sense that it is not possible to understand human subjectivity outside the sphere of labour, and yet, labour as such is a fundamental abstraction. In the ‘Grundrisse’ Marx uses the term atmosphere, something that has become so pervasive, ubiquitous, that we do not realize it anymore. In architecture, abstraction has always been perceived as this idea of being timeless, indifferent to the context, to social content, but on the contrary, abstraction has always embraced this external conditions. We can only think of abstraction within this relations that precisely make them relevant, and strategic. Otherwise, it would not be possible to govern this relations. Money is indeed an instrument of governance, and as such it is an abstraction that becomes relevant because it responds to a very concrete problem. What actually was the physical, architectural manifestation of this ethos? The police, who was a sort of internal control of the city, was the first institution that dealt with urban problems, with the legal aspects by which society could be governed. Paris is the place where this institution becomes important for the first time. The amount of information that the police had to deal with is so immense, that at a certain point there were problems of how to manage this complexity of informations. There is a very interesting project for a paper holder, where you see actually a room where all the officials are dealing with this pieces of information, and behind the walls you have this gigantic machine that basically organizes all this informations in files, which are controlled, checked by this people that are in the room. One can really say that this is one of the early attempts to build a computer, or as the French would say, one ‘ordinateur’. Here we see this kind of idea of abstraction, where almost the representation of society, which was exactly what the police intended to do - not through images, not through narratives, but through data - required a completely different way to construct this representation, where in fact the whole idea of representation is gone. The most interesting detail is this contrast between the incredible refined frame of this paper holders and the abstraction of this files, where the representation of the cities within the abstract paperholder, abstract source of information. This is one of the most ironic and perhaps one of the most comic representations of how architecture is overcomed by this complexity that a modern industrial society requires. I would like to introduce a few categories that I think are crucial to discuss the way actually abstraction becomes evident, within the culture of architecture, within design. Of course, we have to go a little bit back, even before what we would call the industrial revolution, because my hypothesis, that I would like to discuss through this seminar, is that the manifestation of these necessities of abstraction is something that takes place even before the industrial revolution. Architecture is one of the first fields of knowledge in which the strategic relevance of abstraction becomes clear and quite visible. The first category is the one we all share: the plan. By plan I mean first the general idea of the plan, of planning something in advance, which is something that in architecture fully emerges only in the fifteenth century. Within the building of architecture there was very little distance between conception and execution - it’s only from the fifteenth century that conceptions and execution are basically divided, and this division, as I will argue in the next seminar, has a very specific, political raison d’etre. So in this reorganization of the production of architecture, the plan plays a fundamental role. For me it’s interesting that the plan has an origin that is before the invention of architecture as a project, already in the 800s, were in fact new institutions, new typologies required new organizations of space, and what is interesting is that the plan here, an instrument, an abstraction, the moment in which the administration of life becomes a fundamental raison d’etre for the institution of new forms of government. One of the first manifestations of this idea of the plan as an abstraction is actually the architecture of monasteries. This is one of the most interesting drawings of the history of architecture: the ideal plan of a monastery, which you can find in the library of St. Galle, in Switzerland. It’s one of the first known architectural plan (not the first, there are not first things in history, but it’s one of the first known); an early example of a building described through it’s plan, in clear orthogonal projections, before orthogonal projections were theorized. What is interesting about this drawing is that it makes clear that one of the fundamental aspects of monastic architecture, which is always considered a place of contemplation, of belief, was precisely the administration of life, because one of the fundamental conditions to be within a monastery was to transform life itself, in all its daily activities, from eating, sleeping, reading, talking, into an ‘opus dei’. So, in the monastic tradition, religion is not only a periodical collective gathering of individuals, is not a kind of personal relation with god, but it’s the transformation of the totality of life, in its most daily needs, and aspects, into a sort of permanent, sacred representation. For that reason, monasteries had to deal not only with the representation, the church and all its symbolism, but also with the administration of life, with the most basic needs that the reproduction of life requires. it is interesting that you have the plan: the sort of instrument or apparatus that divides human activities into very specific spaces. The plan becomes actually a diagram: it loses all its symbolic representation and becomes simply a typical plan. The appearance of new typologies, like the monk cell, a room where one person can live, but also the latrines, so the most banal equipment that makes life reproducible within this kind of space. Here you see a very interesting phenomena: a building that really tries to define life in its most biological, daily conditions. The only way to govern this condition is to abstract architecture from its representations, from its symbolism, into an abstract machine, an apparatus. Not simply to reinforce the belief of the monk, but support his material life. The moment in which this becomes crucial in the political administration of society, architecture, in order to be executed, in order to be transmitted, is reduced to a diagram, to an abstraction, which influences the material building of architecture. The important passage of design is exactly the abstraction, the abstraction of plans, of sections, or of very sophisticated computational systems. The object of this abstraction is the management of life. Here you see this very direct link between abstraction on one hand and the attempt to manage life, the most concrete, materialistic dimension of our daily experience. The second category, perhaps the most obvious one is the importance of geometry in construction of modern architecture. It’s true that modern architecture started - at least in the Western world - with the Renaissance, which was a revival of ancient architecture, but it’s also true that the interpretation given to ancient architecture in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries was profoundly mediated by this necessity of the plan, necessity of the project. Architects had to struggle with the archeological evidence of ancient buildings, because this evidence represented a legacy that was full of irregularities, full of differences, and one of the fundamental goals of Renaissance architects was to regularize, to describe this legacy within a legible, intelligible design process. So, geometry becomes very important, as you can see in the work of Filippo Brunelleschi, who is one of the first architects that constructs a grammar of architecture based on the legible geometric schemes. What it is interesting about this building is that the module is figured on the facade is the one that Brunelleschi used for the entirety of the plan of the building, something that was unprecedented at that time, where different parts of the building would be always disconnected. Through measure and a modular design, Brunelleschi is able to construct a virtual grid, where not only the building but also the urban space is inscribed. Next week we’ll see what were the political and social impetus for Brunelleschi to embrace this way of design. What is important is to see how perspective was invented not to represent on a two dimensional plane the depth of space - Brunelleschi is known to be one of the inventors of perspective (we will discuss how this sort of authorship is rather questionable), but he embraces he perspectival science in order to really understand his buildings, no longer within simply the existing modes of perception of the city, but to reconstruct modes of perception where his buildings would be seen not as objects but as systems. Coordination, repetition, plays a fundamental role. It’s also interesting that geometry has an even more humble application: the most interesting example for me is the first book by Sebastiano Serlio, ‘On Geometry’. Serlio published the book one and two ‘On geometry and Perspective’ after he published the book three, which is the book ‘On the Architectural Orders’, the fundamental canon through which Renaissance architecture was transmitted, and he even said in the introduction of the first two books that that wasn’t without reason, that the first two books were dealing with very boring subjects and therefore to start the edition of the books with that will damage the reputation of his work. It is precisely in book one and two that Serlio introduces a new way of thinking about architecture, which in fact uses geometry not in a sort of pristine forms that Brunelleschi would give to his own representation, but for Serlio, especially in book one, geometry is an instrument to correct the irregularities of space. Once an architect is given an awkward site, geometry becomes an instrument to measure that site, and give it a measurable form, which will be important in order to parcel in intelligible forms the land. This process of parcelling is fundamental for the way capitalist economy will affect the ground of cities. Geometry is an abstraction, but becomes very practical in dealing with the pressures and conflicts that start to emerge within the city. Serlio will devote one of his books to what he called accidents, which is basically irregular sites. The art of geometry, then, is not only to superimpose a Platonic grid, or a Platonic object, but it is an instrument to make sense of what is increasingly irregular, increasingly under the pressure of market forces, and therefore needs an instrument to create an order within that chaotic situation. What it’s interesting of Serlio’s geometries, compared to Brunelleschi’s is that they are far less ideal, much more tied to the accidents of the real urban space. At the same time, Serlio introduces this concept of ‘linee occulte’, hidden lines, that Serlio sees as a very important instrument in order to govern this increasingly complex urban space. His book two is interesting because perspective at that time was a discipline studied more by painters than architects, but, as in the case of Brunelleschi, for Serlio, perspective was important for an architect in order to break down the design form of the project in measurable parts. Serlio said the hidden lines, the construction lines are often more important that the visible lines, to the point that he even argued that sometimes the ‘linee occulte’, this invisible lines, hidden lines can become the real form of architecture. This is an interesting moment in which the semantics of architecture almost collapsed and a new kind of simplified, but also commercially more effective way to define architecture, a very modular system becomes evident. This allows us to go through the third category, which is form as object. Form, like plan, is a word that emerged quite late, in the ancient times there isn’t a word in the Western tradition, and I wonder if also in other traditions there isn’t a word for form: we have morphei, we have eidos, but the concept of form as we understand form today did not exist, as something removed from content. (For instance) the person who looked to Michelangelo’s fresco in the Cappella Sistina would be impressed by the specific colour of one figure or the specific shape of one object, because at that time, the experience of form was always tied to the idea of narrative, to the idea of meaning. Having a form as such was a complete nonsense in the aesthetic experience before the eighteenth century. Under very specific social and cultural pressures, not least was the protestant reform, which is not a reform of the catholic religion, but a rethinking of the social ideological structures of that time. The role of image as a narrative, as a representation was heavily under question, and therefore also architecture, since, unlike today it was never understood as a value-free semantic system - think of the orders: the classical orders had a very specific gender symbolic identity, so it was not driven by structural problems, but was to project architecture as a system of references. Architecture as imitation of nature, for instance, which is an imitation of all classical architects, fifteenth and sixteenth century architects, is not the imitation of nature as we understand nature today: nature at that time is god. Architecture, the correct use of the orders is no less than an approximation of an idea of god. That is why the discussion of the orders, of the canon of the five orders becomes a very hot discussion at the time: because the breaking of rules has important, semantic but also ideological consequences. It is precisely under the pressure of reform, like the protestant reform, when in fact, the whole role of representation, of enacting secret images through representation, is put into question, that architects force to disconnect form from content. Form becomes an object that doesn’t mean anything but itself. One of the most striking examples of that process is the architecture of Michelangelo. He is one of the first architects to compose architecture without following the grammar of the five orders. His approach to architecture is very much driven by his sense of plasticity, of course Michelangelo is a sculptor, but at the same time, he is one of the first artists to be very sensible to the protestant reform, and the critique of the role of images in the representation of the sacred. So, what he does in his architecture is what the art historian Alexander Nagel has called strategies of soft iconoclasm, meaning a kind of step by step removal of the capacity to represent from architecture. This is one of the details of the Laurenziana library, where he invents this capitals, that do not belong to any of the five orders. He creates a capital that does not speak anymore, that does not represent anything, it’s just what it is. These columns are load bearing, so they are structural elements: so he refuses the role of the column as a representational ornament. \nHere we enter, if you allow me, the sort of dematerialization of architecture. Architecture is almost devoid of its representational properties. This is the right moment to introduce one of the fundamental categories through which architecture has absorbed the phenomenon of abstraction, the one that is perhaps more familiar to us: the idea of diagram. A few years ago I did an article which was against diagrams, a critique of diagrams, I think at that time I was very naive, but my reaction was much more to that kind of abuse that was typical of the architectural discussion around, let’s say 10 years ago, especially in schools. As I started to teach I realize that students were not making architecture, they were simply making diagrams. So one of my first essays was really a critique to this idea of diagram - I didn’t say that diagram is dead, but I came close to that wish. Since i’m becoming more pessimistic, I think that diagrams are very important, and that there is no way out of diagrams, I’m afraid. So, we have to reopen the discussion on diagrams, that is one of the things that I will pursue in the seminars. Diagrams are something that in the discussions about architecture have arrived only in the first 50 years, slightly more, but is a kind of recent item within the arsenal of architectural strategies. This diagrammatic understanding of architecture is far older, and the plan that we were seeing before is already a diagram. This is also why i had to reconsider the diagram, because a plan is a diagram, there is very little to say: the diagram is the kind of drawing that transcends the material properties of a particular structure, so all kinds of architectural drawing is fundamentally a diagram. There are interesting examples that show how this dematerialization of architectural matter is already at work, for example in the 20th century, when an architect like Francesco Di Giorgio Martini draws examples of possible ancient times building plans, so this is not really a project but more a catalogue of possibilities of how to organize domestic space, so this is really a thinking of the palazzo, which is a very interesting typology, with a very controversial history, starts to become a type. At that point the problem is not to design one building, but to organize a possible catalogue of ready made solutions where in fact the problem is not so much the representation of space, as you see Martini only drew the plans, not the elevations. The problem of orders is gone, the problem of the elevations, which, you have to understand that in Renaissance architecture the elevation is often more important than the plan. Architects, think of Palladio, were thinking of the building through its elevation, and the plan was always an attempt to support that image that sort of image that the elevation brings forward. In that context it’s a very radical drawing, in fact this kind of reform of domestic architecture is conceived not through its elevation, but through its plan. What is striking is that Martini does not draw the thickness of the structure, so the structure is not a problem here—it’s the last reminiscent element of the material dimension. He uses this technique of line drawing, which in fact is an abstraction of the real building, but an abstraction that has to do with what at this point is perceived as a fundamental problem of domestic architecture, which, as we’ve seen before, is the administration of life. This type of designing architecture goes even further at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century, with for example the ‘Precis’ of Durand. Durand is an architect that devoted most of his life to the teaching of architecture, actually he was not teaching architects, but engineers, who, as Durand wrote at the introduction of the ‘Precis’ had very little time for design. Durand’s Precis is a kind of hand book, not to design good architecture, but just to design as fast as possible. There, he presents this plate and what you see on it is not like in the case of Di Giorgio Martini, an abstraction of the plan, and the sequence of spaces; but what Durand represents here are actually the compositional principles. The kind of underlying parti that will allow every architect to design every building. One of the most radical examples of this process is the architecture of Ludwig Hilberseimer, who in very radical terms embraced a post architecture history of design. One of his most radical buildings is the proposal for the Chicago Tribune in 1922, which was one of the first international competitions for a new headquarters building. Many architects took part in it, and it’s the first time when the technique that has supported material production is incorporated into a place where material production is immaterial, it’s based on exchange, on human communication. So, in a way, it’s also recognizing the industrial nature also of that kind of work, which was manifesting itself in Germany, especially in Berlin in the 1920s, where for example there were - only in Berlin - something like 26 newspapers, so imagine the amount of workers, writers, freelancers, precarious intellectuals who were gravitating around this sort of form of promotion. In fact, the answer of Hilberseimer is to see that form of production within the same conditions that organize also industrial material production. His response to this competition is this empty building, where architecture has gone, because the plan is simply a readymade industrial structure.\nBut perhaps the most radical manifestation of abstraction within the history of modern architecture, and maybe one of the most influential archetype of modern architecture was the Maison Domino, designed by Le Corbusier, almost exactly a hundred years ago. Le Corbusier designed the building try hard to find a company who mass-produced this building, which by the way Le Corbusier imagined just in 1914, so just in the beginning of WWI. It was really an attempt to forecast the rebuilding of Europe after the war. He attempted to propose a methodology that was completely industrialized, where in fact what would be provided was simply the framework; the contents, the organization of the building itself would be self-customized by the inhabitants. It’s also interesting that what it’s really prefabricated in the Domino is not actually the concrete panels, and columns but the steel form that was necessary in order to pour the concrete and achieve this building form. Here, Le Corbusier tried to link cheap labour: the construction in situ of the building, with an industrial method of production, which is exactly the way favelas, or all kinds of self-help towns are built. We always perceive them as informal, but in fact the technical procedures that allow this forms to be easily built are industrialized: the materials, but also the techniques. In fact, the Domino model initiates for Le Corbusier a rethink radically the way architecture is built. Not only the building itself, but Le Corbusier rethinks architecture by its building process, which is presented as a kind dematerialization of the floorplan. Once you have this dematerialization, the floorplan is available to any kind of use, to any kind of arrangement of the interior space. Here you see the link between abstraction and the social complexity within which abstraction becomes strategic. Also, you see something more scary than that, at least for us, architects, who are always worried about our authorship, our subjective identification with architecture. What Le Corbusier does here is in fact to remove the authorship as it had always been understood. He arrives to a kind of moment in which architecture is simply the readymade of industrial and juridical processes. In fact, the creativity of the architect is almost gone, because Domino represents a model in which the industrialization of architecture produces architecture without the need for any significant contribution of the architect. This is really how we design housing today, I would argue that housing today is a given diagram. If you take part in any competition, or you have the opportunity to build housing, you realize very soon that you can still play the facade, and chose some nice materials for it, but the actual organizational scheme through which housing, but also other typologies are produced is the materialization of a diagram. The distance between the core and the facade, the dimension of rooms… In that sense, what Le Corbusier forecasted is exactly this condition, where in fact, the abstraction of procedural legal aspects of architecture takes over what Vasari would call the invention of architecture. This is actually the challenge of abstraction: on one hand, the pessimistic side, is this kind of removal of the problem of authorship. I think Mario Carpo has written very interesting reflections on this with more contemporary examples that the one I presented today, with processes like BIM, or all this kind of design instruments which in fact creates an almost authorless condition, where perhaps the only author is the market. For me, the most interesting side is that what abstraction in architecture could put forward is that architecture is always produced collectively: it’s always the outcome of a shared, collective form of production. That’s the challenge of this seminar, in my view it does not eliminate the problem of authorship, it does not eliminate the problem of invention, which I think are still important aspirations within architecture. The challenge would be how to rethink this possibility of the singularity of our actions as architects, within this realm that I’ve described that has so profoundly undermined the possibility of being an author in architecture. In the seminar I will really invite you to dive into this condition of abstraction, where our individuality is challenged in very radical terms. As Walter Benjamin said, and I’ve put this this epitaph also in the beginning of this seminar is by giving our individuality to the masses, perhaps one day this masses will repay us with compound interests.

The ambition of the research conducted by AADRL Director Theodore Spyropoulos and his students is to pursue a pattern logic that is poly-scalar, allowing bio-diverse patterns to operate between urban, building and material agency.

        "detail": "Lecture date: 2013-05-20\nHow To Build An Office was conceived within our larger idea for the ‘professional practice’ element to Night School, to act as everything you didn’t learn in Part 3 and the realities of working in practice. The idea was to have six practices of different shapes and sizes discuss, over two sessions, how the nature of their practice has opened up, limited or defined their architecture.\nPaul Finch chaired both discussions and noted that it was a rare opportunity to discuss the structures, formations and nature of practice in school but in fact its not actually discussed that much in practice either. However, the current model of architectural education is more based on structures of practice than we imagine. Finch elaborated on this theory by explaining schools employ people, they have programmes and have to produce a product – end of year shows, which are designs produced by people within the institution: ‘that fluidity between what we think of as exclusively education and exclusively practice on examination, there are tendrils of both extending into one another.’\nThe first presentation of the second session was made by Jim McKinney of Tony Fretton Architects who spoke of a meta-design discussion and meta-practice discussion as a way of talking about talking about what we do.\nJoe Morris of Duggan Morris, a husband and wife partnership, presented next, Morris previously worked under Simon Allford at AHMM who told him, “Joe you know fuck all”, when he started his own practice! Contrary to this Morris presented his multi-award winning projects and gave us an insight into the practice’s structure, a classic pyramid with everyone at the bottom – directors, senior staff, cleaners, assistants, admin who are all working towards the cultural ambition of the practice.\nWorking on an entirely different scale, Jim Eyre of Wilkinson Eyre was the last practice to present. The practice is large and internationally prevalent. With over 30 years of experience, Eyre gave nuggets of advice which hadn’t been discussed previously. Firstly, avoid debt as much as possible, ideally keep 3 months turnover in the bank and you’re safe, although difficult in today’s climate. \n \nhttp://conversations.aaschool.ac.uk/night-school-how-to-build-an-office/",

From the earliest human shelters to the sophisticated structures of ceremonial architecture, the search for perfect fitness has addressed issues of materiality, construction, climate and culture. The past century has introduced a new paradigm to this search: demographic realities of exploding population and increasing urban density. Environmental qualities previously taken for granted – sunlight, openness to view and nature, the integration of plant life with human habitation – are all under threat. New urban concepts, as well as architectural and urban design inventions, must be considered to maintain and enhance the fundamental aspirations so essential to the human spirit. Moshe Safdie is an architect, urban planner, educator, theorist and author. Embracing a comprehensive and humane design philosophy, Safdie has been a visionary force in architecture and urban design for more than forty years.

        "detail": "Itsuko Hasegawa is known for kicking against the grain of architectural expectations. At a time when architecture demands more public involvement, and architects work as facilitators, or even administrators, she is prepared to lead, challenge and, sometimes, to be unpopular. However, Hasegawa builds lasting connections with the communities she works with. For this lecture, Hasegawa will address her approach to her work and explore ways in which architects can negotiate with clients, the public and planners while also retaining control and exercising design leadership.\nThis lecture is part of a series of events taking place at the AA to coincide with the the RIBA exhibition, Venice Takeaway: Ideas to Change British Architecture (26 February – 27 April):\nFor the first time, the exhibition from the British Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale is being updated and brought back to Britain. Venice Takeaway presents the work of ten architectural teams that travelled the world to seek imaginative responses to universal issues. Charting a course across Argentina, Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Nigeria, Russia, Thailand and the USA, the installations and objects of Venice Takeaway encapsulate ideas for change and remind us that the practice of architecture is as much about observation and thinking as it is about design.

She worked on the principle that things that have not yet become art are more important than things that are art already. Inspiring choreographers and theatres throughout the world, Pina’s works do not seek to teach, do not claim to know better; instead they generate experiences and create driven, moving images of inner landscapes while exploring the precise state of human feelings.\nArchitectural thinking and dance practice have much resonance to one another, sharing philosophies and perceptions, as well as the creation of space in relation to the body and our senses. The evening will reveal this shared territory between architecture and contemporary dance alongside members of one of the leading dance companies in the world.\nThe evening will be hosted by Takako Hasegawa. Barbara Campbell-Lange – architect and the AA academic coordinator – will also join the conversation.\nDominique Mercy is a choreographer, dancer and the longest established member of the Tanztheater Wuppertal. After the untimely death of Pina in 2009, he took over the role of artistic director of the company.\nPeter Pabst is a set designer who has designed and produced theatrical spaces for the Tanztheater Wuppertal for more than twenty-five years.\nA video Projection of Tanztheater Wuppertal’s work will be screened from 17.00 with the conversation taking place at 18.00.\n \n \nImage: Scene from ‘Vollmond (Full Moon) Photo by Laurent Philippe",

        "detail": "This lecture is in collaboration with The British School at Rome.Architects and Designers working in India are now dealing with an entire gamut of social, cultural and economic phenomena that are moulding the built environment at rapid rates. In the process, the role of the professional architect has been marginalised – for within conventional praxis, the professional does not engage with this broader landscape but rather chooses to operate with the specificity of a site and, thus, in the process often becomes disconnected with the context of practice. As a result, the approach of Working in Mumbai uses the city and region of its operation as a generator of practice – as a way to evolve an approach and architectural vocabulary that draws its nourishment from a more elastic definition of the profession which sees multiple disciplines as being simultaneously valid in engaging with this kinetic landscape. The lecture will be divided into two parts. The first section will entail a presentation on Mehrotra's reading of the city of Mumbai and the implications that working in Mumbai has on architectural choices, questions and issues. The second half will cover projects across India that attempt to express the (architectural) sensibilities that have evolved by working in Mumbai.Rahul Mehrotra is a practicing architect, urban designer and educator.  His firm RMA Architects was founded in 1990 in Mumbai and has designed and executed projects for clients that include government and non-governmental agencies, corporate as well as private individuals and institutions. RMA Architects has also initiated several unsolicited projects driven by the firm’s commitment to advocacy in the city of Mumbai. Mehrotra has written and lectured extensively on issues to do with architecture, conservation, and urban planning in Mumbai and India.

Primarily aimed at 2nd and 4th Year students to complement their TS courses, the debates are also open to all interested attendees. PLUS was born to address the richness that remains hidden behind every design in order to reveal the unknown depth in the design process. The series also discovers new design horizons by bringing together experts from different fields to express viewpoints on design topics in order to search for links and conflicts centred around current design drivers in architecture. Respondents and those attending the event will lead the discussion, following the experts’ contributions, and feed their own vision and expertise into the design-process dynamic. The first session of PLUS will address what drives action and reaction in various design processes. For example, what motivates the action to win, to be more economical or to survive? How can these influencers adapt and shift the design process of architecture? The conversation will investigate the process of Formula 1 cars versus the slow action and reaction process of biology in favour of a continuous equilibrium between the subject and its environment. How do closed or open design processes affect the realisation of a product? Here we ask whether current design strategies in architecture can be seen or learned from one of the above. How has the reaction of architecture changed based on actions, needed or provided?Session 1 Participants:Ralph Koyess, Lotus Renault F1 Car designerJulian Vincent, BiologistAdrian Priestman, Vector-FoilTecAnna Winstanley, Laing O’Rourke",

How do we write a new history of the recent present?\"\nThis series of three open lunchtime lectures is delivered by Anthony Vidler and hosted by the AA PhD Programme.\nSeminar Two: From Townscape to Postmodernism\nAt 3pm a seminar for PhD students only will followRethinking the Modern PicturesqueReadings: Ivor de Wolfe, and Gordon Cullen, “Townscape,” Architectural Review, 106 (December 1949):355-362; Anthony Vidler, “Troubles in Theory: Part 2: Picturesque to Postmodernism,” Architectural Review, Vol. 231, No. 1379, pp. 78-86.\n ",

        "detail": "Stanton Williams’ design for the new University of the Arts London campus for Central Saint Martins at King’s Cross unites the college’s activities under one roof for the first time. It provides CSM with a substantial new building, connected at its southern end to the Grade II listed Granary Building, a rugged survivor of the area’s industrial past. The result is a state-of-the-art facility that not only functions as a practical solution to the college’s needs but also aims to stimulate creativity, dialogue and student collaboration.\nThe lecture will reflect on the design considerations that led to the creation of this stage for transformation – a framework of flexible spaces that can change over time to invoke new interactions and interventions.\nPaul Williams formed the partnership Stanton Williams with Alan Stanton in 1985. As founding directors they have been responsible for the creative direction of the practice since its inception. In November 2011, Stanton Williams were judged to have made the most significant contribution to British architecture over the past year and were presented with the BD Architect of the Year Award 2011 along with the title of Education Architect of the Year. Williams is actively involved with the concept and design development of many of the studio projects, including the UAL campus for Central Saint Martin’s at King’s Cross, Issey Miyake Shops and the Eton Manor site for the London Olympics. In 2005, he was awarded the title of Royal Designer (RDI) for sustained excellence in design throughout his career.Photo © Hufton + Crow",

        "detail": "Today, the urban appears as a kind of generalised background of life. At once an immediately recognisable condition, it is also one that permanently escapes our grasp and remains just beyond the horizon of perception. Yet what precisely do we mean by the category ‘urban’? While more people talk about it, build and live within it, few have asked the basic question of what exactly it is. This talk will offer a brief history of the urban by examining a subtle relationship at its heart – between circulation and political order. If the urban has become a universal datum of life today, it can do so only as a political category.\nRoss Adams is a writer, architect and urbanist. He has worked in offices such as MVRDV, Foster & Partners, Arup and Productora. He has taught at the Architectural Association, the Berlage Institute and Brighton University. Currently he is a PhD candidate at the London Consortium and teaches urban design at the Bartlett.\n \nThis is the third of the ongoing History and Theory Studies lecture series organised by Mark Cousins, Mollie Claypool and Ryan Dillon.",

Emerging during a period seemingly threatened by urban insurrection both at home and abroad, and in which military technologies and paradigms of governmentality were increasingly addressed to figures of insecurity, this lecture asks: for whom was this environment to be invented?Felicity D.

Coates believes the same to be true for architecture.In this talk, the renowned architect will map some key ways of working with narrative and put these in the context of his own practice. Since the days of the NATØ group, narrative has sustained all of the architecture that interests Coates – both built and theoretical. On the home-front, Coates brings narrative to his work to function as an agent of humanity. In this lecture, he will argue that all endeavours in the realm of art, architecture and design must be approached from a broad and open perspective that cannot shy away from matters of urban decay, the architectural body and social transgression. Instead, an architecture informed by a variety of lenses can reveal the rich potential of the ordinary and the close at hand.This lecture will celebrate the launch of Nigel Coates’ Narrative Architecture, which is published by Wiley.",

Open to all.\nEthos is a Greek word that can be roughly translated as 'character'. Ethos addresses the ethical principles and guiding beliefs of a given society. It is possible to argue that every architectural theory – implicitly or explicitly – addresses the ethos of the historical time in which it is written in the form of architectural principles. Even if, traditionally, architectural theory mainly addresses practical issues – such as problems of construction, design, and ornament – it nevertheless casts a light on the peculiar subjectivity of the period in which is formulated. \nThis seminar argues that although theories of architecture address how to design and build as well as govern a city, all theories of architecture can be considered political theories, since their precepts address the way space is materially organised and constructed. Treatises and texts on architecture from Vitruvius to Alberti, Vignola to Perrault, and Durand to Venturi will be introduced throughout the course. The seminar aims to investigate how the considered texts can be used as projects for the city.\nThe seminars will take place at 1.00 on the following dates:\nTuesday 9 October: Vitruvius’s On Architecture \nTuesday 16 October: Leon Battista Alberti’s De re aedificatoria\nTuesday 23 October: Sebastiano Serlio’s Seven books on Architecture, Jacopo Vignola’s Canon of the Five Orders of Architecture, Andrea Palladio’s Four books on Architecture \nTuesday 6 November: Claude Perrault’s Ordinance for the Five Kinds of Columns after the Method of the Ancients, Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand’s Précis of the Lectures on Architecture\nTuesday 13 November: Le Corbusier’s Towards an Architecture, Ludwig Hilberseimer’s Metropolisarchitecture\nTuesday 27th November: Robert Venturi’s Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, Aldo Rossi’s Architecture of the City\nPier Vittorio Aureli is an architect and educator.

It frequently involves the use of what the course will represent as the Imaginary.  It proceeds by looking at aspects of architecture and design from both the point of view of the Cliché and the imaginary.",

As current design-oriented fields have amplified the implementation of computational and generative tools for various motives, the process of documentation and representation of the design process has become more difficult to express. As such, Translate the Intangible will bring together a multi-disciplinary group of leading practitioners from different fields to discuss the challenges involved in expressing the process involved in their work and propose new perspectives addressing this issue.\nThe symposium will also serve as a platform for the PhD in Architectural Design students to present and discuss their individual research with the invited speakers. The day is divided into three sessions. Each session will last for two hours, and will include a presentation by two PhD students and two invited speakers under a specific theme. During the final hour of each session, the moderators will open up a discussion that follows up on the session’s theme.

        "detail": "This compilation of texts written since 1986 reveals a parallel activity to Alejandro Zaera-Polo’s professional life. The book is like a sniper’s log, a register of events and accumulated experience, for the purpose of identifying tendencies and assessing performance, rather than to establish truths. Written for different media and formats, texts are threaded together as a biographical experience determined by temporal and geographical factors. More than 500 images capture the time of these writings, providing a background to trigger associations.Alejandro Zaera-Polo (born Madrid, 1963) is the founder of London- and Barcelona-based practice AZPA, which integrates architecture, urban design and landscape architecture, working for public and private sectors on an international scale. His work has consistently merged architecture with theoretical practice, identifying social, economical, technological and political trends and translating them into architectural discourse. He trained at the Escuela Técnica Superior de Arquitectura de Madrid and Harvard GSD. He worked at OMA in Rotterdam (1991–93), prior to establishing Foreign Office Architects (dissolved in 2011). Zaera-Polo is Visiting Professor at Princeton and Norman Foster professor at Yale. Previously he was Dean of the Berlage Institute in Rotterdam (2000–05) and held the Delft University Berlage Chair; he has taught at universities in the US, Japan and at the AA. His writings can be found in El Croquis, Log, A+U, Arch+, Archis and Volume, among other publications.",

        "detail": "The lecture will present a 25-year journey of how art and creativity have become a catalyst for revitalization in an urban community. It will further illustrate how the Heidelberg Project has become the driver of a new art movement in Detroit as our city struggles to find its new industry/identity.Tyree Guyton is an artist born in Detroit in 1955. Primarily a painter and sculptor, Guyton has also been described as an urban environmental artist. He has waged a personal war on urban blight on Detroit's East Side, transforming his neighbourhood into a living indoor/outdoor art gallery. Through his art, Guyton has drawn attention to the plight of Detroit’s forgotten neighbourhoods and spurred discussion and action.'When you come to the Heidelberg Project, I want you to think – really think! My art is a medicine for the community. You can’t heal the land until you heal the minds of the people', says Guyton.This iconic colourfully painted polka-dotted neighbourhood, which symbolises society’s diversity, has played a vital role in transforming the visual indignities of poverty and has placed an international spotlight on the area, resulting in dramatic reductions in drug-trafficking, gang violence and crime. Guyton’s vision for Heidelberg is to transform the two-block area into a state-of-the-art cultural villageGuyton exhibits his work extensively throughout the United States and the world. He studied at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit and in 2009 was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts. His work is featured in the Detroit Institute of Arts, the University of Michigan Museum of Art, the Studio Museum of Harlem, among many others. He has received more than 15 local and national awards.His work has been featured in major publications, books and television (including the Oprah Winfrey Show) and was the subject of the Emmy award-winning documentary, Come Unto Me, the Faces of Tyree Guyton. More recently, it was the subject of Connecting the Dots, Tyree Guyton’s Heidelberg Project—a 2008 Michigan Notable Book (WSU Press 2007).Jenenne Whitfield has served as the Executive Director of the critically acclaimed Heidelberg Project for the last 18 years. Under her direction, The Heidelberg Project has expanded its goals to include acquisition and restoration of property in the Heidelberg area, development of an artist-in-residence program and implementation of community art and education programmes.  Her leadership and commitment have enabled the project to extend its reach by participating in joint projects with museums, universities and other educational organisations. Her work has been rewarded by a growing worldwide interest in the message she embraced on that summer 18 years ago when she made a wrong turn on to Heidelberg Street and unknowingly asked the artist, 'What is all this?' The answer still resonates.  She left a successful banking career to join the project.Organizational Awards and achievements received under her leadership include:Michigan Notable Book Award, Connecting the Dots, Tyree Guyton’s Heidelberg Project (2007)Outstanding Community Achievement (2006)Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence (2005)Environmental Design Research Association (2004)Emmy Award Winning Documentary, Come Unto Me, the faces of Tyree Guyton (2000)In addition to her role as executive director for the Heidelberg Project, Whitfield lectures regularly with  Guyton and also served as Vice Chair, for Create Detroit, an organization inspired by Gov Jennifer Granholm’s Cool Cities Initiative, that connects and supports ideas, events and opportunities to drive cultural and economic vitality in Detroit. Recently, Whitfield worked with Matt Clayson and the Creative Corridor on the Rust Belt to Artist Belt III Conference in Detroit especially to connect young local artists to the programme. She also served as a panellist and interviewer at the April 2011 event.",

        "detail": "The presentation will focus on the re-activation of late-modernist templates about architectural interventions on infrastructure. Since the Second World War many of these templates have been ambitious statements on behalf of society, which nevertheless were either forgotten or ridiculed. Today, however, the field possesses the means and insights to upgrade and realise some of these concepts, such as the open platform-building, the megastructure, the monumental grouping. The practice seeks to learn from failed attempts historically, but nevertheless, in cannibalising history, aims to insert a sense of continuity into the modernist project.D’Hooghe and Peeters are partners in the Organization for Permanent Modernity, an architectural and urban design firm comprised of an academic group at MIT in Boston and a professional practice stationed in both Boston and Brussels. The formalisation and objectification of infrastructural elements is central in their current work. Projects include a masterplan for the slaughterhouse district in Brussels (including a 25,000-square-metre market building); a series of public facilities and town centres around Brussels; a plan for the protection and expansion of the coastline between France and The Netherlands (2009); and a competition-winning entry for a large landfill in South Korea (2008).See www.orgpermanentmodernity.com\nThe formalization and objectification of infrastructural elements is key to the current work in the organization. Current projects include a masterplan for the slaughterhouse district in Brussels (including a 25,000 sq.m. market building), a series of public facilities and town centers around Brussels, a plan for the protection and expansion of the coastline between France and the Netherlands (68km, 2009), as well as a competition-winning entry for a large landfill in South-Korea (401 sq.km2, 2008). The organization comprises of both an academic group group at MIT, and a professional firm stationed in both Boston and Brussels.\nAlexander D’Hooghe is associate professor in Architectural Urbanism at MIT. He directs the ‘Organization for Permanent Modernity’ in Boston. Not only a professional firm but also a academic group at MIT, D’Hooghe has both groups interact around the same discipline, and also published for the organization internationally, most recently with ‘the Liberal Monument’ (Princeton, Fall 2010), and has papers in relevant journals in Germany, Israel, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, US, etc. D’Hooghe obtained his Ph.D. at the Berlage Institute in 2007 i.c.w.

What we term a “Rrelational design” urges the creation of a mutual encounter with local conditions such as matter/energy properties, specific human resources and the environment. It constantly invents processes and experiments, which can help to trigger awareness of local and original space-generating possibilities and achieve a more integrated relationship with their surroundings. Relational design thereby addresses both specific spatial qualities as well as the design process itself.The lecture is structured in four chapters:Environment explores the context specific interaction within a given natural, vernacular and industrial environment. Transformation projects bring into play and are developed from existing structures, waste and historical processes. Materiality projects explore the intrinsic spatial potential of material systems on a macro and a meso scale. Urban Development examines the interrelations between social, programmatic, cultural and economic domains.\nReinhard Kropf is co-founder, along with Helene Stangeland, of the Norwegian practice Helen & Hard. ‘We aim to creatively engage with sustainability, not only in the design of spaces, but also in the conception and organisation of the design process, including construction and fabrication.

        "detail": "A lecture on the state of architectural history, criticism and theory, and how we arrived at the present impasse.\nFrom the intense exploration of postwar theory (Cullen, Rowe, Banham, Smithsons), to the post-structuralist ‘revolution’ (Tafuri, Derrida), to the postmodern reaction (Portoghesi, Jencks), to the present digital divide.

The second time I thought of troubles in theory was some days ago when I received a 400-pages white volume which claimed to be a comprehensive unified theory for architecture. After reading it I realized that theory was in real trouble, precisely because someone had realized that to deal with the problems existing, a unified theory (which in the end was nothing of the sort) had to be written. I present, therefore, two quotations: “we lack of a satisfying theory of architecture” Christian Norberg-Schulz, 1965, and “a comprehensive, unified theory of architecture is important.” No-one has attempted to unify theories of Le Corbusier and Pevsner, since perhaps The International Style, or perhaps since the work of Christian Norberg-Schulz and then, Patrik Schumacher, Parametricism. Today I will give the shortest version of the history of architecture theory that I can give in an hour, following a book I have been writing for the last ten years, with the aim to deal with the notion of theory that has emerged since the Second World War. I have the feeling that all the troubles in architecture theory, and in architecture itself, have been driven by wars. Wars have produced the economy of the global market, which have produced the economy which drives architecture, which has produced the need for theory that accommodates, or sometimes resists that global market. Many histories of architecture since 1945 completely ignore the war: certainly the Second World War and all the other wars. They only talk about the war in terms of post-war reconstruction. It is my thesis, and the one of my friends and colleagues Jean-Louis Cohen and Beatriz Colomina, that the war had much more powerful an effect on the theory of architecture. Hence, the notion of anxiety that I place in the front and foremost of my architecture theory, which is itself a mode of dealing with anxiety on one form or another. I will focus today on those theories of architecture which have been based on a series of visual understandings about architecture that were formulated between 1940 and 1945, and which have continued to operate within the architectural paradigm.\nArchitectural theory has taken many forms since Vitruvius, who attempted to put in ten scrolls all the principles of the discipline, with the conviction that an architect should know writing, both to “secure more lasting remembrance to his figure” in other words, to be remembered, and to balance with knowledge, his manual skills. It is an interesting and heterogeneous book, as Alberti noted, it is written by an engineer without much literas, in bad, engineer’s latin. But he put together what he could find of Greek and Roman precepts, with an enormous amount of knowledge that he gained on the war part, with Caesar. In the seed as described by Vitruvius, gives architecture a place in the war economy of ancient Rome. Towards the Renaissance we find Alberti, writing for the war lords of central Italy, a text which will instruct them on the importance of architecture in the development of their defences, but also of their fame, their economies and their pride. Both in Filarete with the Sforza family, and Alberti with the Medici family we have the same relationship between architecture and war, and architecture theory developed as a fundamental amateur of a new, mercantile economy. So from Vitruvius to Alberti, Palladio, Cesariano, architecture theory is constructed as a way of understanding the architect’s place in the world through the act of drawing. Drawing becomes important from the very start. In the seventeenth century Vitruvius is translated and given new life, through the academies of France and incorporated to the teaching manuals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Theory moves from the comprehensive treatise to the teaching manual, to the style manual, from Blondel’s teaching manual on the course of architecture, to the Repertoire of historical building types of Durand, to the style manuals of Classical and Gothic architecture in Viollet-Le-Duc. Then, in the early twentieth century the manifesto. Theories are no longer comprehensive, but developed in such a way that could be placed on the front page of a newspaper: the new architecture, the new spirit, the new mechanistic civilization. The futuristic manifesto, it is an act of war, that celebrates war, and the power of masculinity embodied in the new technologies of warfare and it is based on the notion that war will erase, war will bring the tabula rasa that architecture needs to construct in order to be triumphant. In this context comes this very strange book, somewhere between a manifesto and a treatise of architecture form and formalism: Vers une Architecture. The former book was somewhat embodied in the extremely pervasive and influential book The International Style written Henry Russell Hitchcock and Philip Johnson for the Museum of Modern Art exhibition under that title of 1932, where modernism is codified as a style, ready to be incorporated, until the war intervened, into the smooth, corporate, development of American industry and society. The generation that graduated from architecture schools in the decade that followed World War II, was a generation in search of new principles for architecture itself. In the shadow of the modern masters, as shown in the front page of the 1965 edition of Architectural Design with a photograph of Le Corbusier and Mies talking to each other, edited by Peter Smithson, where he goes decade by decade through the modern movement, somehow wanting to exorcise for his generation the shadow and the heavy weight of dealing with this modern masters. Others of younger generation, like James Stirling will find in Ronchamp and in the vernacular style adopted by Le Corbusier after the war, a strange rupture with the supposed rationalism of modernism and will attempt to find other languages. The question is how do you deal with this monsters; this elephants in the room: Corbusier, Mies, Aalto and before that Frank Lloyd Wright. This generation was critical of the social and urban effects of the international-style modernism, yet they were reluctant to abandon a commitment to modern architecture. They looked in different ways, either for continuity or to avoid the crisis they realized it had been produced by the war. A political crisis, in Italy, that Ernesto Rogers tackles rebooting Casabella, calling it Continuitá, but ‘continue’ in a slightly different way because the crisis of fascism has to be dealt with. The crisis and continuity debate occurs all the way through the 50s and 60s, as reveals the opening of any of Tafuri’s essays from the 60s on, with the question ‘are we dealing with crisis or continuity in relation to the architecture discussed. In Britain the crisis was less political, with labour winning the first post-war election. If continuity was to be sought, it was with a need for a tougher response to the tough modernism of Sweden; or to the polished, corporate styles of the US. Thus, for example, the adoption of the word brutalism in relationship to the first efforts of the Smithsons. In this search, architects were supported by the Architectural Review’s editorial board. Despite the individual sensibilities, the journal hosted the debates such as the one posed by Colin Rowe’s Palladianizing Le Corbusier; or Eric de Maré’s attempt to be vitalized by canon; together with Banham’s new Brutalism, among others. At the same time, the journal offered a very consistent teditorial position, against what Pevsner called the new historicism. Celebrating the opening of the second half of the century, the January 1947 issue, edited by J.M. Richards, Nikolaus Pevsner, Osbert Lancaster, and Hubert de Cronin Hastings opened with a bold statement of policy, which argued for widening the scope of the review, side by side to provide with the obligation of educating the public on the art of architecture, mainly through the BBC radio 3 program. Visual culture is the foundation of this new understanding of architectural theory in the post-war. The pursuit of the visual life was presented in Landscape and Townscape, one of the earliest uses of the notion of townscape. The first half of the century—they wrote, although it is possible to identify Pevsner as the prime author—has seen the drama of the modern movement. Thus was then summarized in an imaginary two acts, or pictorial resume: act one, where Ruskin, Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement prepare the ground; followed by act two, which traces the natural development of new visual symbols, and the acceptance of new building techniques. Pevsner argued that now a third act was needed in order to bring new visual principles to technological expression. This act will bring back the most English tradition: the picturesque. My understanding of England at this time is indebted to the book ‘The Picturesque’ by Jack McArthur, student of the AA, and of Mark Cousins, who is now teaching in Australia. His book is the best contemporary treatment of the picturesque. The act of restating the picturesque is an attempt of Pevsner to rescue the richness discarded by the modern revolution and to work for re-humanization, to the pursuit of differences rather than sameness, the re-emergence of monumentality and idiosyncrasy. The visual, said Pevsner, allows for a continuity of tradition, in which historic precedent can be used constructively and not as an escape. All the architects of that generation assimilated this principle, from the more abstract reference of the Smithsons, to the more liberal one of architects like Sterling. In this principle were bounded all the complex strands that were to preoccupy the Architectural Review over the next thirty years: the dedication to visual experience, the identification of such an experience with the themes of the picturesque tradition and the demand to make this themes both more permanent and graphically visible to the public at large. Also the seeds of what Pevsner himself would observe some forty years later as the return to historicism; the postmodernism that Charles Jencks celebrated so strongly, in what he called ‘postmodern movement architecture.’ This principles had already been developed three years before by Hastings’s writings in February 1944, under the title ‘Exterior Furnishing or Sharawaggi: The Art of Making Urban Landscape.’ In the book, Hastings looked back to the time of Ebenezer Howard and Raymond Unwin, willing to allow the decent life in decent surroundings: the social mission of the editorial board. It portrayed the popular picture of the semi-Tudor (Andrew Ballantyne has just produced a beautiful and very witty book on the Tudor style, as it emerged and spread across the suburban landscape in American England in the 1930s, 40s and 50s). Hastings noted that England was no longer head of the international aspirations of architecture, as it had been with the arts and crafts movement. Hastings argued for a serious need for a picture—in the most literal sense—that would reconcile visually in the mind’s eye what appeared to be irreconcilable elements in any town plan: monuments, traffic, short buildings, tall buildings, individual properties, etc. Thus, he advanced a solution: the picturesque theory, as it evolved in England in the eighteenth century and was internationalized in the early nineteenth. There was a need, Hastings argued, to resurrect the true theory of the picturesque and apply it to the city. Photographs illustrated the idea of the street picturesque, its liveliness, and the ways in which it constitutes an urban landscape. As a model, he took the description of Christopher Hussey’s “Classic Study of the Picturesque.” The art of landscape picturesque, he claimed, was identical to what the chinese called Sharawaggi or irregular garden.\nOne party, Le Corbusier, had moved towards the rationalism; the other, leaded by Frank Lloyd Wright, towards the romantic or the organic. There is a third movement that might be called the English or radical, since it neither belongs to any of the above categories. An aesthetic theory had been presented with the claim that modernism was actually picturesque, and therefore very English in spirit. That such a theory was implicitly counter-modern, if not post-modern, was demonstrated by the theories of Alan Colquhoun in a letter responding to Pevsner’s claim that Le Corbusier was influenced by the picturesque. Colquhoun argued that Pevsner’s Le Corbusier was an entirely visual fabrication, owing nothing to the rational, internal, ideational content of his architecture. Colquhoun vision was closer to Colin Rowe’s image of Le Corbusier, in “The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa” (1947) and “Mannerism and Modern Architecture” (1949) in the Architectural Review: that a modernist had manipulated the geometries of Palladian plans and the intricate techniques of mannerist facades with the vocabulary purist abstraction. The moment of opposition between picturesque townscape and the Palladian revival, which influenced the work of Peter and Alison Smithson, was brief: the Smithsons said it was over by 1948.\nToday, the oppositional nature of Rowe’s “Collage City” to “Townscape” seems less abrupt. In this context, it was entirely logical to find Robert Venturi’s first article, published under the rubric “Townscape” in May 1953’s issue of Architectural Review. Venturi’s thesis employed a case study: the Campidoglio (Rome). He argued that Michelangelo’s formalizing of the Campidoglio had been injured by the ignorance of the principle that “the architect has a responsibility towards the landscape which he can enhance or impair, for we see in perceptual wholes, and the introduction of any new building will change the character of all the other elements in the scene.” Venturi, and in a sequence of figure-ground plans and sections, demonstrated the point: Michelangelo had modified the piazza, so the original senatorial palace was given emphasis by the contrasting elements of the flanking buildings, colour, texture and the neutral rhythm of the column facade. The introduction of the huge monumental palace for Vittorio Emmanuelle: a shiny monster, had destroyed the setting.\nWe can see the transition from the visual theory of townscape to that of postmodern taking place so easily, and early. When in 1966 Venturi finally published the work he had done in 1954 in Rome, the shift was complete. Under the guise of returning to an original autonomy for architecture, Venturi catalogued the ways in which modern architecture could regain the richness seemingly lost through modernist abstraction, using all the techniques employed by history to revive the complexity and contrast of the urban scene and to restore visual complexity. This was perhaps a direct response to the purely visual theories of townscape, that a number of architectural theorists tried once more to regain the sense of a discipline. Beginning with John Summerson’s appeal for the ‘programme’ as a fundamental source of unity for modern architecture (he drew his inspiration from László Moholy-Nagy’s sense of a biologically-grounded formal aesthetic); followed by Reyner Banham’s ‘Stocktaking’ of February 1960, which called for a new technological basis derived from cybernetics and computer science; and Peter Eisenman’s first forays into formalism in 1963, publishing his call for a ‘formal basis of modern architecture’ in ‘Architectural Design’ (AD), the pressures for a rigorous and unified theory intensified. \nBy the 1960s, however, a second postwar generation was concerned to counter the positions again, constituted around the traditional divisions of function, technology and form as they were. It is very interesting that Summerson takes ‘Utilitas’, Banham takes ‘Firmitas’ and Eisenman takes ‘Venustas’. This was a new generation that had a sense of what Banham had called, hopefully, ‘une architecture autre’ it is not to be founded in any formalism, but in a reframing of the discourse through technology and social science. ‘Architectural Design’ (AD) took the lead on this, under the editorship of Monica Pidgeon and Theo Crosby, and later Kenneth Frampton, supporting the Smithsons and their allies in Team X, but also, such widely disparate positions as those of Cedric Price, of Archigram, as well as those of John Turner, with his reports from Lima spearheading investigations into the potential reconstruction of the barrios, or the world ecological consciousness of John McHale, who edited a special issue in 1967 on ‘2001’, reviewing the state of world resources and anticipating his seminal books ‘The Future of the Future’ and ‘The Ecological Context.’ You could read this book—‘The Ecological Context’ which was published in 1969—today, as if it were an immediate and present enlightenment of the questions that concern us  in terms of environmental sustainability, and environmental control, and environmental chaos.\nAs Beatriz Colomina and her colleagues have made clear in the book ‘Clip, Stamp, Fold,’ a book and exhibition devoted to the little magazines of the 1960s and ’70s, by the late ’60s ‘theory’ had been co-opted by a proliferation of these ‘little magazines’ representing an increasingly radicalised generation intent on countering the conformist axioms of the profession. Even AD was transformed into a hip broadsheet, with its signature section ‘Cosmorama’, started in 1969 when Peter Murray joined Robin Middleton as art editor and began the wild ride to be the architectural equivalent of the Whole Earth Catalog. Here the move to environmental, ecological and social issues was clear. ‘Casabella’, on the other hand, under the editorship of (Alessandro) Mendini, was supportive of the groups like the Banham xxx the technological aspirations, and the technological architecture xx exactly the same xx 1930 by Buckminster Fuller, and then by McHale, who xx work with Fuller. Mendini, however, was supportive of groups like Superstudio and Archizoom, who stood apart from architecture and critiqued it, with this extraordinary dystopian visions; Archigram published its own ‘journal’ (from 1961), as did Jean Aubert and Hubert Tonka of the Utopie Group (from 1967) in France. In total opposition, yet fascinated by the potentials of architecture to inflect society, Guy Debord and his friends published the Internationale Situationniste from 1958 on, with their definitions of the new urbanism.\nThis counter-architectural movements were balanced during the 1960s and 70s by a series of appeals to renew the language and spirit of architecture itself, after the perceived  barrenness of the hegemonic International Style, by Venturi, obviously, Paolo Portoghesi and so on. All these movements developed manifestoes, but around 1968—and not necessarily as a result of the revolutions of that year—things theoretical seemed to change. Architecture, rather than a subject discussed by architects and architectural theorists, however much against architecture they were, became a subject of interest from outside. That is a big shift in the late 1960s, as the architecture theory shifted from being developed from inside architecture to appeal outside and to develop its own understandings, to looking outside architecture for a theorization of its own discipline. Architecture, rather than a subject discussed by architects and architectural theorists became a subject of interest from outside: from philosophy, epistemology, linguistics, and most importantly, politics. With the Marxist critique of institutions, from (Louis) Althusser to (Henri) Lefebvre, architecture—already under attack from the right and the left for its apparent failure to address the social problems of the postwar period—became an object of inquiry as an ideology, similar to those identified in Marxist theory: law, religion, the state. Architecture, (was) now understood in Althusser’s terms as an ‘ideological state apparatus’, and thereby an instrument of state power. It was a moment fuelled not by the role of architecture in representing or constructing the State, or aestheticising Capital—the foundation of all ‘Theories’ of architecture—but equally by the politics of resistance that emerged in the opposition to the Algerian and Vietnam wars, to the neo-liberal capitalist governments of the postwar period, and to the consumer culture of the 1950s and ’60s that threatened to de-politicise the class and ethnic struggles of post-colonialism.\nThis argument was advanced on the far left by the institutional critiques of (Michel) Foucault, and reinforced by the textual critiques of Roland Barthes and Jacques Derrida. In a move towards what today might be called media theory, Pierre Bourdieu, Jean Baudrillard and Paul Virilio analysed the relations of architecture to representation, traditional cultures, technology and social mobility. The most effective of those interventions within architecture itself was perhaps that of Foucault, whose investigation of disciplinary discourse was centred on the institutions that had developed significant architectural typologies since the 18th century—asylums, hospitals, prisons—and whose writings from 1965 to 1974 inspired both critics and architects to rethink the idea of typology on an architectural and an urban level.\nThese texts were taken up by architectural theorists, not as before, as supplements to the design process itself—anthropologists and sociologists acting as ‘humanising’ influences on the theories of Team X, for example—but rather as invitations to rewrite the theory of the discipline. Let us give some examples out of many, Foucault’s history and epistemology of the institutional discourse—asylums, hospitals, prisons—launched a wholesale critique in architecture over the nature of power and its sources, hidden and overt. Barthes’s essays on semiology introduced architects to the structural analysis of buildings and cityscapes as communication devices. Derrida’s deconstruction of philosophical and literary texts led theorists to question the commonplaces of their own practice. Deleuze’s study of (Gottfried) Leibniz and the Baroque precipitated interest in the typologies of folding [showing a diagram drew by Deleuze in his book on ‘The Fold’ which is about Leibniz’s understanding of the operations of senses in developing ideas in the brain: his diagram of Leibniz’s house is actually taken from his reading of Wolfflin’s ‘Renaissance and Baroque’, it is actually not the interior of the house but the facade of a baroque church], and of course, (Jacques) Lacan’s rereading of Sigmund Freud allowing for a new understanding of the relations between visual gaze and desire. In each case, the intent of the transmigration of theories from outside to inside was to unpack the verities of the profession and disclose the hidden ideological agendas behind apparently innocent practices, and I think, probably most effective or the strongest effect of those theoretical interventions was felt by Rem Koolhaas and Bernard Tschumi, among others. I want to emphasize this, because there has been a great deal of conversation in the United States about the notion of a post-theoretical, or post-critical generation that it is not interested in reading theory; and to me it is not surprising, given that the theories that were developed outside architecture, and specifically the theories of the Marxists on the left, and of Foucault, were in fact fundamentally against disciplines as a whole, as ideological constructions of power by the state, and therefore, against the notion of architecture as a discipline at all. And, actually, it produced no understanding for a whole generation of architects of how to do architecture, how to produce anything from architecture: there were not productive theories, there were, literally, deconstructive theories, and left a whole generation of students and architects with the sort of weak—I think—manner of trying to illustrate those theories, in certain ways, rather than incorporating a theory of production out of their theory of deconstruction. It was a reaction against this over fragmentation of the architectural body that a number of critics called, once more, for a comprehensive and overarching theory. Tafuri explained it, in 1968 (‘Theories and History of Architecture’):\n‘It is symptomatic, in fact, that there is a demand from many quarters for the establishment of a rigorous theorization of architectural problems. This need is felt by a considerable number of English-speaking critics − particularly by [Peter] Collins − by historians like Christian Norberg-Schulz, by specialists of planning methods like Christopher Alexander and Asimov, by theorists involved in planning, like Aldo Rossi and Giorgio Grassi.’\nSo we have, in the mid-1960s, an attempt to rebuild architectural theory comprehensively: Christian Norberg-Schulz, tried to bind the body back together again, in a long-drawn-out assemblage of observations on almost every aspect of architectural thought: historical, semiological, programmatic, technological, and, above all, phenomenological. Experience was the key and ‘experience’ was the key; balance, the method. This coherence was to be achieved, Norberg-Schulz claimed later, by introducing the phenomenological theory of architecture, this time joined to the newly popular and restored to postwar legitimacy, the Heideggerian vision of wholism and in Norberg-Schulz’s ‘Existence, Space, and Architecture’ (1971), that tries to assimilate this holistic theory of Heidegger. As we know, Rossi and the neo rationalists where to take a more structuralist position, influenced by the structural anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss, attempting to link the underlying structure of the traditional city to developing typologies of the contemporary. it was, in 1975, finally we have Rossi’s Analog city, that places together all the images and typologies of present cities. It was in 1975, finally, that the apparently opposed visions of Townscape and Rowe’s version of the modernist collage came together in the seminal article, again published by the Architectural Review, Collage City, anticipating the exercise of reformulating the figure ground plan of Rome, in the Roma Interrotta exhibition of 1978. It’s very interesting to contrast the article Collage City, which has most of the text of the book Collage City, with how the reception of that article then transformed the text of that book, Collage City: the article is a lot fresher than the book, which was, i think, very over-edited, some photographs from article, contrasting the expressionist to the classical ideals of the Renaissance. The Roma Interrotta exhibition, which in fact collaborated with Collage City, by producing a collage of 12 panels of the map, put together from 12 architects. By 1980, the pictorial re-envisioning of historical architecture, characterized by Paolo Portoghesi re-enactment of archtiecture without inhibitions, as he called it, in the Strada Novisima of Venice’s Biennale, that confirmed Pevsner’s suspicions that the new historicism was in the air, but in a flamboyant manner, far from Pevsner’s imagining. That, I guess, ended in that [slide: Philip Johnson holding a model of AT&T building, NYC]. This initiatives, however different in form, were based in the idea that architecture, more than anything else, was a visual art, experienced through vision and communicating its effects and meaning visually. If you actually look through Charles Jencks’ ‘Architecture 2000,’ and look at the various categories, 80% of the categories that are listed there are visual categories, not programmatic categories. All pretensive adherence to any newly formulated programs, such as those posed by Summerson, was abandoned. That’s the difference between townscape and collage, as I mentioned was that Townscape viewed the city from the ground, google street; while Collage viewed it from the air; google earth. The brief countermovement, so-called deconstructivist, in a strange but catchy neologism, between deconstruction and constructivist, fabricated by Philip Johnson and Mark Wigley, was however equally visual in its processes, whether in plan or three dimension, as a sort of demonstrated antipathy to any classical or modernist forms of composition, but a complete conservatism in terms of the product. Only the presence of Rem Koolhaas, not very appropriately situated among this exhibitors, gave the sense that programmatic argument, leading to a reformulation of typology and precedent, within a deliberate and ironic reframing of the modernist debate between Le Corbusier and Mies, gave one the sense that more than a visual outcome could be expected from this movement. Rem’s later transformation of Townscape into the concept of Junk Space, was the last nail in the coffin for a purely visual approach to architectural theory. Save, perhaps, in the more recent attempts to theorize the productions of an increasingly sophisticated digital architecture, from the animate architecture of Greg Lynn to the parametric autopoiesis of Patrik Schumacher. Here we are given once more the sense that a comprehensive theory of architecture is possible, one now based on the apparently all-encompassing systems of modelling and iteration, produced by parametric programs. For Lynn, who has coupled his research into the production of newly topologically defined surfaces, with a research into the new material fabrications methods of boat building and sail making, the synthesis is now between mapping and fabrication. With Schumacher the potential goes even further, in order to have an entirely new style of architecture, which relates naturally to the ever changing complexities of the social and economic system. In both, however, the result is judged visually. In Lynn’s case by the conviction that the baroque forms are better than the minimalist forms of early modernity; in Schumacher’s case by the theoretical conviction that in the end all architecture could be defined according to the rules of its style. In both, architecture retains a certain autonomy of form, only to be subsumed beneath the process of a technologically driven system society. The problem, of course, is that what actually drives architecture, and has driven architecture for millennia, is entirely ignored, or rather accepted as the given, as to be irrelevant: the economy. And, more importantly, these theories ignore the fact that all new architectures have been and probably will be in the foreseeable future: war economies. Vitruvius proposing a systematization of the discipline to help Augustus expanding the empire; Alberti and Filarete appealing to the warlords by referencing the grandeur of ancient Rome, Le Corbusier after the WWI working to divert the production processes of the Voisin aircraft company; the digital revolution of the present, emerging for the WWII machine and continually refined in the ongoing wars of the present. Architecture, I’m prepared to predict, will no longer have to assert its autonomy at all, it will soon be theorized—as the drone already is—for the neoliberal capital takeover of the war economy. Thank you very much.\nTranscription by María José Orihuela, Architect, MA HCT at the Architectural Association.",

Of crucial importance to these programs is their ability to mediate and reify informational bodies – inputting, conditioning and outputting data such that program-specific value and meaning are added to all three phases and posited as ontologically equivalent objects. Within this mode of design, the urgency for discretely structural strategies is paramount. Structurally Intelligent Swarms is presented as a research trajectory that explores the set of techniques and results of having combined swarm formations, FEA software and evolutionary algorithms within parametric modeling that induce intelligent structural morphologies. Further, these morphologies are situated within normative architectural assemblies by means of explicitly defined grafting techniques and tested as new wholes. Architectural speculations are made as to refining engineered capabilities, expanding on programmatic applications and testing integrated SIS assemblies at alternative scales.

He was chair of the Olympic Design Review (2006–10). Among many honours he was awarded an OBE for services to architecture in 2002.\nLecture Transcription:\n[Video is momentarily cut at some points]\nBrett Steele introduces Paul Finch.\nPAUL FINCH: I’m going to do a quick A to Z of certain architecture education issues, and then we’ll look at some slides dealing with London’s past and present, mainly AA alumnus or former AA teachers.\nLet me start by answering this question: is architecture education is the answer, what was the question? let me give a journalist proposition: the question is how do we set about creating better futures, which we know will be different to the present, when all we have to go on is the past? My “A” is for the “architect” which is very much about the past, because the condition of architecture today is entirely dependent on the history of what happened at the end of 18th century. What happened in Britain is pretty much a simulacrum of what happened elsewhere, because it happened here first. At that time, organizations where all looking for what today we’d call single point responsibility, they didn't trust the “Wren” figure, who is the genius designer who miraculously, not only can he understand geometry and mathematics and philosophy and physics, but also knew all about the organization of people hammering nails into wood and so on. At the end of the 18th century you get a rise of the main contractor, the family builder, usually specialist in joinery or some other subcontract activity, who suddenly claims they would organise the site and the construction and they know more about that than the designer. To cut the long story short, the emergence of architecture as a profession, and a discrete activity, and something reinforced by caste, class and education, is an economic response to the challenge of contractors to the hegemony of the master builder, in reality a master architect. By the 1830s, when the profession in this country institutionalized itself, and forms in 1834 what becomes eventually the RIBA. By that stage you see the emergence of these family contractors, as shown in the records of the ministry of defense, specially around gentleman’s clubs around Pall Mall and in St. James’. We have to understand that economic competition had a very profound part in the emergence of the architecture profession, because architects in response to the changing economic conditions had to establish their own unique role first, because the client shouldn’t trust tradesmen, and then because they, the new professions where subjects of economic competition. So the architects claim, reinforced by the professional codes, that the architect should never compete in price: you pay the same fee whoever you get. A system, incidentally, which lasted for about 160 years. However, trade, would always be appointed as the result of the most ruthless economic condition, encouraged and controlled by the architect. Not only did the architect encouraged that economic competition, but the architect was judge and jury in all the buildings throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century, because they had quasi legal controls over the contract. So, if there was a dispute, it was the architect who resolved the dispute, not a judge, nor an arbitrator. The architects what is such a position, that if the client was god, the architect was the archangel Gabriel, while everyone else in the world were lower angels. This then becomes reinforced because of the inevitable education consequences of professionalization, which restricts the entry into the profession by examination. That’s a different story, which I don’t want to go into, because, in theory, the AA shouldn’t be started by students, it should have been started by their bosses.\nHowever, by the end of the 19th century what we have is a situation where, to become an architect you have to pass examinations, often, for middle class families who are essentially bossing about working class tradesman on building sites. This is a caricature, but it’s not so far from the truth, the position that we have today is quite different, because the dismantling of all those structures, partly as a result of Thatcherism, but it pre-dates it, because even before - she won the elections in 1979 - we had the dismantling of fee scales, as the result of the monopoly’s permission, and the office of their trading, who assumed, that even advisory fee scales by any professional institution is in fact, as George Bernard said, and he was quoting Adam Smith, “a conspiracy against the public, or against the laity.” That long line of thought which says that if it’s a range, then it’s a cartel, and it must be bad. The lucky thing about the people who said that, they never had to go back afterwards and check, whether their advice, and the ripping up of professional scales was or not in the public interest. It was assumed not to be so. Now we find that architects are not only no king of the castle, they are part of what you might call flat pyramids, or in some instances, they are beneath the contractor: what an extraordinary turnaround! where contractors are negotiating the price with the client, and architects have to compete to get the work on the basis of fee bids! This extraordinary social and political turnaround, I think we hardly got to grips with it, because simultaneously, there are still plenty of contracts out there being run in the old model, where the architect is the client’s will holder, and you do assume, that if the architect is not in the contractors and the subcontractors, the client is highly likely to get ripped off, and you will notice that the regulation of architecture, another characteristic of all professions, but these days you cannot leave it to the profession institutes, you have to have a state body, and this is true pretty much throughout the world, in our case the architects registration board, but, is there a board that regulates builders? Certainly not! The public has to sue a builder, but everywhere else in the world you can mess the architect around by making complaints to some sort of professional board, which, generally speaking do extremely little for a extremely large amounts of money.\nMy “B” is for “building”. Building information systems, building information management is I think, inevitable, it’s growing, and if I was to make a prediction, I would say that the change in the way that professions work together to create buildings will be as profound in the next 10 years, as it has been in the last 10, and that’s because collaboration is, more or less, going to become compulsory, and it’s going to be easy, because it’s going to be on the basis of digital technologies.\n“C” is for “cities”. Until about 20 years ago, few people, outside the realms of United Nation’s experts would have predicted that by the middle of this century most people on the planet would be living in urban environments. This was great news for architects, because the more urban things become, the more you need people who can civilized the buildings, who can civilize the spaces, and the landscape so that we don’t all go mad. On the other hand, especially in Britain, there is still the dream, that actually an Englishman’s real place is that cottage in the countryside. (...) We have to remember that this business is about cities and people, and it doesn’t mean that the world is covered in cities! The density of Singapore, for instance… half of it is jungle! Let’s not get confused between cities, the architect’s new natural province, and open and natural space, they are not opposites, they are going to exist also.\n“D” is for “design and build”. (...) The question is how do architects establish relations with clients, which allow that the question of quality does not become the province of the contractor, but remains the province of the designer. This critical point, I think, it’s crucial to the future of professional design. There are plenty of people out there, who are actually making a living out of doing worst versions of what a good architect designed. (...) The contractor’s claim to authorities is that they speak the same language as the client, but they don’t, they speak their own language, and it’s a very odd language indeed.\n“E” is for “education” itself. Education: critical to the creation of architecture as a profession, because it’s a defining moment; it defines entry into the profession in the first place. Now, every single professional has to undertake something called lifelong learning or continuing professional development which is immaculately tick-boxed by box-tickers in various places. So, you read a magazine, you answer the questions and then you fill in the answers and you tick a little box in your CPD, it says nothing about that you can design nothing at all. What do you know is not independently validated, is a little of hocus pocus, but it is part of the necessary ideology of order which is a plague on architecture construction and many other activities.\n“F” is for “finance and fees”. There is a probably exaggerated dystopia around this, how architects are going to be working for builders and not be able to charge for anything… Happily, there are other models, my lord Foster, for instance, who’s just buying at the cost of 30 million dollars, the summerhouse and grounds where president Obama used to enjoy summers, until Norman decided he liked it quite a lot himself. You can make money out of architecture, there is no question about that, you have to think about what services you are offering, who to, and how you are charging for it. This is stuff, by an  is not taught at architecture schools, but I think it’s essential, because you can not think anymore “mm… 6% of that contract, sounds like it should keep me in the fish and chips for a few weeks”. It doesn’t work like that anymore, and the brutal realities of commercial life, I suggest, mean it never will again.\n“G” is for “government”. Generally, I think it’s not a huge friend of the professions, because no sooner do professions establish themselves, in this country, actually, in 1688, as part of the Glorious Revolution, when knowledge ceases to be a province of the crown and instead becomes, as if it were, neither the church, nor the state, and they claim to represent knowledge, and independence. That is why whenever you get a fascist takeover, let’s say in Portugal, when general Salazar came in, what was the first thing he did? to shutdown professional institutes, included the architects. Dictators are very concerned about what architects get up to, because they understand how symbolically powerful design is, they want to control it, and particularly, they do not want independent knowledge, and certainly, they do not want independent organizations of any description. There have been plenty of radical architects in the twentieth century who combined architecture and politics, eventually very successfully.\n“H” is for “history”. From observation, I think, architectural history doesn’t get as good a run in architectural education as it ought, and I think this is understandable, after all, if you had a completely successful history of architecture, it does start to look as a history of everything. Where precisely do you stop? Should art be in it? Yes, it should rather. But then, science? yes, it should rather… Any building, however modest, and try to understand the circumstances of who wanted it, and designed it, where it is, why is it there, how was it made… you’ve actually got a complete search of history of an entire area and an entire economic structure. Somehow, architecture tends to shy away from this a bit, I suggest it shouldn’t.\n“I” is for “infrastructure”. In the new world of cities, isn’t it the case that in the master section, it becomes more significant than the masterplan? After all, you look at the Olympic site, what are the significant things there? It’s all below the ground! It’s the sewage, the diversion of water, it’s sorting out pollution and poisoning of the ground. Once you do that, once you’ve sorted out where the tube lines are going to stop, the disposition of the buildings quite often speaks for itself. The masterplan is a wonderful sort of work for architects: everything below ground, eventually comes up above ground, and there, and where flows stop at an underground station, at a sewage outlet, at vents, etc, we need design. Thames tideway, Jubilee line, greatest civil architecture project in London in the 20th century… what are the characteristic of all these? architects! and long may it last.\n“J” is for “just in time”. Unfortunately, the culture of architecture - to stay up all night working in that competition entry in the belief that it’s bound to be better, because your brain is functioning more efficiently at 2 am, that what it would have been at 2 pm the previous afternoon - may be true, but the evidence for this is scant. However, it’s now become fashionable, after all, the delivery of retail goods - where is the warehouse? you don’t need a warehouse, the warehouse is the lorry in which the stuff is being transported until it arrives in one of these stores on Oxford street, eliminate the building, get everything on the move. Architects, simultaneously: why haven’t you done all the building details? Actually, the contractors don’t want all the detail design in case there is a legal dispute: what they want you to do is to have enough design to get going, and then design as you go, and be infinitely flexible. This business of flows, rather than the stop star of conventional architectural production from the last century,  think it’s a very interesting kind of parallel to the world of flows, marvelously analyzed by digital technologies.\n“K” is for “Koolhaas”, the only architect in this A to Z. I mention him because he had a wonderful phrase “Architecture is stuck between megalomania and impotence”. He was referring to on the one hand to starchitects, all the stuff in Southern China, and yet, on the other hand, not begin to get anything built. And I noticed that the OMA exhibition of the Barbican… their hitting rate on getting stuff built - of designs for a winning competition is not great, it’s about 20-25%, the rest of it is a vast array of, depending on your point of view, waste of time, or research for the next one. The other thing about Rem Koolhaas is Delirious New York, a wonderful psychological exploration of architectural history in a unique, unrepeated form. Incidentally, if you re-read it now, the phrase “PC” comes out a lot, and you think, did Rem come up with “politically correct” about 20 years before the phrase came into popular culture? Actually, no, it’s paranoid-critical, which is a condition.\n“L” is for “liability” in an increasingly litigious world. What I would say is that all architects get sued eventually. When you get sued it’s like a journalist who is sued for libel, that is to say, you are supposed to be innocent to prove guilty. It really doesn’t work like that, if you are at the wrong end of a negligent action, you are going to have to show everything properly. That is why those boring bits of Part III and educational practice is so significant: if your files aren’t in order, you are going to get done, and that’s all that there is to it. It’s one of the characteristics of professional life, there will be much higher standards on what’s expected from you that what’s expected of great subcontractors. You have got to be immaculate. \n“M” is for “media”, and it does strike me that actually, communication and architecture become more and more entangled. People are designing information systems that happen to be a building. An understanding of all those new media technologies, which may be a problem for older clients or older members of the profession. i simply observe that there is an assumption that media takes care of itself in the schools. Perhaps it does, but it may be worth looking at.\n“N” is for new technology. The biggest change, since I started on Building Design, in 1972, you coul dhave walked in an architect’s office then, it would have looked quite familiar to Thomas Hardy: t-squares, dust… what a change ! we are utterly changed. When you look at what archigram did with that very crude technologies… it’s incredibly sophisticated now, that’s why they were really good. But the reality was that architecture production was really out of the art until very recently.\nMy “O” is for organizations because one of the things that I know is  taught occasionally, but that artists need to completely understand, is the nature of organizations themselves. How generically do they operate? How do the power structures flow through them? This is very interesting material for schools of architecture, again about flows, empowered by authority and responsibility. That’s about decision making and about where the money comes from. If you want a local example, I just read in The Standard this evening that Tottenham Hotspur just managed to get themselves out by paying a £16m contribution to the regeneration of Tottenham, on the back of their £400m redevelopment of their ground, because they say they can’t afford it. The major is picking up the tab because there was a riot, and if you look at all the interest groups and say, why should Tottenham Hotspur get away with that? Now, public money is going to be used to pay for that social housing, and then there are other people say: why is Tottenham going to pay for social housing? why is Tottenham going to renew the tube stop, isn’t that a public obligation? So, you get this mix of money, and power, and politics, and the election - which side, what’s Boris (Johnson) going to say, and Ken (Livingstone)... This is a fascinating territory for architects to understand.\n“P” is for “planning”. Inherent and ubiquitous in the world of architecture, yet, unfortunately, too often dismissed as a solo activity, and in Britain, the RIBA has successfully got rid of all the surveyors, and all the money people in the 1870s, then sloughed off planning as a separate institute in the early part of the 20th century, in the same way they later sloughed off interior design, and facade design… I wonder if there is anything left. Anyway, that is bad news. If you look at something like Abercrombie, one of the first presidents of the town planning institute, for him the distinction between architecture and planning is non existent. If you read marvelous books on London, with his plans for London from 1943, the language, the illustrations, it is holistic - unfortunately a lot of his predictions were wrong within 10 or 15 years of its publication. But in this school, I think, it never went away because of that tradition of master planning and a lot of the things being done with landscape in an urban context as well as rural. \n“Q” is for “quality”. How do you quantify the qualitative? The government is busy asking himself, how can you justify the study of English literature at University? How do you prove it has any value? These are extremely difficult questions to answer. Architecture can be simpler, but you always have to beware, and say: people get better, quicker, in designing hospitals, and they say, how do you know? - because I have the evidence. (...) If quality goes out of the window, on what basis can you say you are providing something that can’t be provided by the builder, and employing some designers in the back room who can get through building regs, and then the users can suffer for the next 30 or 40 years. There have to be ways of proving a point about quality and, actually, at an emotional level you can do this, simply by asking that politician, would you want to design a bad school for your child? When you frame it like that, they will say, ‘well, of course not’ and then you say ‘well, let us advise you in that case on what a good one is. When you flip that back, it’s not what the benefits of good design are, what are the costs of bad design? There are many examples of how bad environments have had millenia effects on individuals\n“R”, “research”. Is a building a piece of research? It often is, but research as academics understand it. (...) You have to say it in an ingenuous way: how many ways might there be of solving it. And you use the method of other buildings, so you get into this strange spiral, where - it’s easy for lawyers to get all the brownie points on the research academic assessment, yet, all their work is about precedent, everything they ever talk about happened in the past ! When architects say: I’m going to make a building, and I’m going to solve that problem about how you span that thing, etc, these are inspirations, experiments. At a crude level, its experimental research and the profession has to fight its way round it as it does and is with higher education institutions and their funding thereof, which try to pretend that it isn’t research at all.\n“Sustainability” is a fantastic thing for architecture, because it becomes like functionalism before it: one of this self-justifying mantras that modernism used to validate its activities for today. So the answer to why should it be like that, would be: because it functions better. Now, it is: ‘it uses less energy’ ‘there is less embedded carbon’ why shouldn’t we put that down? ‘because we’ve done the calculations and you should keep the structure and re-clad it’ etc. You can use this stuff anyway you like, wonderful mantra: long life, low energy. My only other book recommendation here is ‘How Buildings Learn’ by Stewart Brand, about some building types that have survived on and on, it’s not mysterious, it can be analyzed.\n“T” is for “training” this is a practical profession, and I was thinking about Hooke park: making, doing, assembling, and understanding how that works seem to me really critical as a distinguishing feature of an architectural education, as opposed to studying architectural history, or structural geometry. Absolutely critical in understanding the nature of materials, assembly, construction, detail, and gravity. This requires collaboration, one of the hallmarks of this profession.\n“U” is for “urban design”. Wren described urban design as authoritarian scriptures, so that was a quite unnecessary new profession, you should do it if you are an architect. But, they have to make their case, and if people decide that is a discipline that they like, then they would buy it. The question for architecture schools is whether one absorbs it or makes it a separate thing, under the great umbrella called architecture.\n“V” is for “vagueness theory”. We’ll come back to it if we have time. Well, it’s the Sorites paradox: a mound of sand, you take a grain away, you still have a mound. At what point, taking grains away, does it cease to be a mound? This has something to do with the joys of imprecision, or calculated uncertainty. The difference between tolerant and fit, this is something architects do understand: the big thing and the small thing, and their kind of roughness. There is something in there of real value.\n“W” is for “winning work”, that is essential, never taught in schools, but you can learn it outside, happily. In a way, the best learning is that crit where you have to stand out for your own design, when you have some people on the client that are quasi clients, because they can be more generous about the design,  but harsher about the clarity of the presentation.\n“X” is the x factor, what is implicit in architecture education is that x of architects to … the unwritten contract, the unknown user. The architect that is designing the school has some sort of relation to someone in 20 years time that is using the building. It doesn’t go away when the contract ends. (...) In architecture education this is transmitted in values, attitudes, absolutely the opposite of the contract led, self interested link which typifies much of the construction sector.\n“Y” is for “Young’s modulus”. I love this - I don’t know if they teach you this in architecture schools - but it’s a measure of the elasticity, and the quick formula for Young’s modulus is stress/strain, and I think it’s almost a perfect description of professional life, both for individual architects, and finally for practices.\nMy “Z” relates to a former president of this institution, that is Roger Zogolovitch. This should be taught in all schools of architecture, because this is about the architect who gets a commission, and gives the client something that is out with their budget, having known the budget in advance, and then spent all their time doing a worse version, and rumbling about the client being a philistine, etc. Zogolovitch said: “you should find out what the client’s budget is, and then give them the best keeper they ever tasted.” I like the economy of thought there.\nWe are going to see a set of London slides.

The AA Research Cluster on Urbanism and the Informal City has sought to give continuity to that work while focusing more specifically on architecture and urbanism as tools of political engagement in the transformation of the informal city and the social conditions associated with it. This year the Research Cluster hosted a series of events that have investigated the role of design as a generative tool in reconceptualising the challenges and potential of informality. The symposium continues this exploration bringing together internationally acclaimed practitioners working directly with conditions of informality in this day of discussion and debate structured around two key themes: design as research and design as strategy. The focus of the symposium is the relevance and importance of design and spatial strategies in scaling-up to the challenges of the informal city and its articulation with the politics of creating socially inclusive cities.Schedule10:00 Introduction, Jorge Fiori10:30 Informality and the City: Engagement, resistance and choice, Josè Castillo 11:15 Architecture, Poverty and Cities, Felipe Hernández12:00–13:00 Discussion13:00 Lunch14:15 Rio de Janeiro’s Experience: Strategies for socio-spatial articulations, Jorge Jauregui15:00 Spiral Stairs, Water Tanks and Carnival Floats, Franklin Lee15:45 Break16:15 Curriculum for an Urban Planet, Alfredo Brillembourg17:00–18:00 Discussion\nAlfredo Brillembourg is the founding director of Urban Think Tank (U-TT), an architectural practice involved in high-profile projects which have resulted in the meaningful transformation in deprived areas in Latin American cities. Since 2007 Brillembourg has been a guest professor at the Graduate School of Architecture and Planning, Columbia University, where he co-founded the Sustainable Living UrbanModel Laboratory (S.L.U.M. Lab) with Hubert Klumpner. Together with Hubert Klumpner, Brillembourg holds the chair for Architecture and Urban Design at the Swiss Institute of Technology (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule, ETH) in Zurich.\nJose Castillo is the co-founder and principal of arquitectura 911sc, an architecture, urban design and planning practice based in Mexico City. The work of the practice has been showcased at the 2007 Rotterdam Biennale, Visionary Power and as part of the Mexican pavillion of the XI Venice Architecture Biennale in September 2008.\nCastillo's built work and writings on issues related to the informal have been published widely. He has lectured at the universities of Harvard, Tulane, Princeton and Berkeley; at the New Museum in NYC at Casa Encendida in Madrid and at the Deustche Architectur Zentrum in Berlin, among others.\nFelipe Hernández is an architect and lecturer in architectural Design, History and Theory (Cambridge). He has worked extensively on Latin America and other areas in the developing world, including Africa, the Caribbean and South East Asia. Author of many books including Rethinking the Informal City (Berghahn Books, 2010) \nJorge Jauregui is an award-winning architect-urban Designer based in Brazil. He has over 20 years’ experience in working on projects in urban peripheries and informal areas, with a focus on social inclusion. His work in the urbanisation and upgrading of more than 20 favelas in Rio de Janeiro, as part of the Favela Bairro programme, has been recognized globally. He has published extensively and has participated in numerous conferences and international exhibitions, including the the 8th Venice Biennale and Documenta, 2007. He has received numerous awards, including the Verônica Rudge Green Prize in Urban Design, Harvard University, Graduate School of Design, 2000.\nFranklin Lee and Anne Save de Beaurecueil are directors of the Brazilian architecture office SUBdV, using a mixture of high and low design technologies to generate socially and environmentally responsive geometries for architecture and urban design projects. They were AA Diploma Unit 2 Masters from 2005 to 2010 and taught at the Pratt Institute and Columbia University in New York, from where both received Master’s degrees. They are currently coordinating the AA Brazil Visiting Schools and are working on architecture projects for various grassroots micro-agencies, ranging from self-organized favela residents’ associations, to carnival samba schools in Rio de Janeiro, to a former boxer champion’s informal sports academy under the viaducts in São Paulo. These projects are realised through a negotiation between formal and informal entities, as well as between public and private agencies, to produce socially empowering interventions, combining computation and digital fabrication with local techniques, materials and economies.",

        "detail": "Curated by Friedrich Gräfling  Three artists – Jorinde Voigt, Anne Hardy and Hynek Martinec – will present methods that were once common in architecture but seem to have been forgotten in the fast-evolving age of digitalisation and computer-aided design. The sequence of the presentations mirrors that of an architectural design process – mapping, designing, rendering and building.First, Jorinde Voigt will talk about how she develops graphic algorithms out of static data, translating music or the flight path of eagles, for example, into a visual display combining points, lines, coordinate systems, numbers, symbols, words, shading and colour. The line is the determinant of Voigt’s artwork. Anne Hardy continues this process by designing a fictional reality through one-to-one models, which are then photographed – a technique that both creates an effect of alienation and gives the work a documentary substance. Finally, Hynek Martinec creates an atmospheric scene around a given design in the form of photo-realistic painting. The artists’ presentations, which focus on their working process, will lead into an open discussion, moderated by the German writer and art critic Lavinia Neff.",

It is a line of reasoning that pits superficiality against depth: depth is idolised as pure, abstract, white, difficult to grasp and serious, while whatever is sensual, eloquent, colourful and essentially non-linguistic is ridiculed as superficial, vulgar, indecent and even pornographic. That which operates directly on the senses is demonised and feared for the potency of its power, and ultimately excluded from ‘serious’ discourse. Colour in architectural discipline and theory is necessarily affected by this categorisation, with its legitimacy, although never its power, in perpetual doubt. This research cluster will begin the process of re-evaluating and restructuring the frame of this apparent contradiction. It will seek to develop a set of spatio-chromatic methodologies and form them into a combined figure of complementarity with – rather than opposition to – theoretical and scientific discourse.\nhttp://www.saturatedspace.org/p/events.html",

        "detail": "Project Japan is a new book by Rem Koolhaas and Hans Ulrich Obrist, edited by Kayoko Ota with James Westcott and designed by Irma Boom. It tells the story of the first non-western avant-garde movement in architecture, and the last movement anywhere to play a crucial role in the economic, intellectual, and architectural (re)building of a nation: Metabolism. Between 2005 and 2011, architect Rem Koolhaas and curator Hans Ulrich Obrist interviewed the surviving members of Metabolism, together with dozens of their collaborators, mentors, rivals, critics, protégés and families. The result is a vivid documentary both of an architectural movement and an activist state that mobilised the most creative forces of its population for a task that, in 1945, seemed impossible. This is a ticketed event. AA students (current registered) can collect a ticket on Monday 6 February from 9.00 from Reception.

        "detail": "The élan of the trajectory of design across the 20th century much resembles the metamorphosis of lines into curves. Analogy can also be found in the longing to escape from the copiable to the uncopiable. The conception and physiognomy of curves are increasingly disengaged from descriptive geometry, desiring instead towards the infinitely variable, free hand, free fall, free form. The new parable of curves is juggling unpredictably in motion, growth, topological field, animate force, algorithm and chaos. The talk traces the story of curves, in 2D pictures and 3D forms, abandoning that which can be captured by Descartes’ curve-drawing devices or vectorial curve extraction, and the impetus of the digital longing for the aura of a curve that cannot be repeated, as jittery as the bulging back of an animal and as evanescent as outlines of deluge.Doreen Bernath completed her PhD at the AA with the award of the LKE Ozolins scholarship from RIBA. Her thesis was shortlisted for the RIBA President’s Research Award 2011. Her initial architectural training was at the University of Cambridge, followed by several years of professional practice as an architect in London, Shanghai and Taipei. Her special field of research encompasses representation, visual culture, architectural production and transcultural studies. She has taught histories and theories, design studio, summer schools and published in numerous universities across the world.\n",

She frequently builds one space in another as an intervention in and comment on it; the spectator moving through the space experiences the dislocation – both spectator and space being neither inside nor outside the original structure.Sosnowska’s work has been exhibited across Europe and worldwide, for more than a decade.

Yet how has the astonishing take-up of this new medium within little over a century been accommodated into our mental universe? While it has transformed the lives of many people, in Western countries it has been widely vilified, blamed for making everywhere look the same, and for erasing nature. Architects and engineers, although they have primary responsibility for ‘interpreting’ concrete, are not the only people to employ the medium, and many other occupations – politicians, artists, writers, filmmakers, churchmen – have made use of concrete for purposes of their own. The results are often contentious, and draw attention to some of the contradictions in how we think about our physical surroundings.Adrian Forty is Professor of Architectural History at the Bartlett School of Architecture, UCL.

Strategically positioned glazed roof lights provide diffuse light throughout the track and infield areas, avoiding direct sunlight.

This is despite the fact the concept of landscape was once effectively dismissed by an influential geographical theorist as being of ‘little or no value as a technical or scientific term’ in geography. It will be argued that the contemporary analytical power of landscape derives in important measure from the timely ability of David Lowenthal to turn the critique of landscape on end. He did this by transforming the very contradictions embodied by landscape which made it a liability as technical or scientific term, in to a phenomenon for epistemological inquiry.David Lowenthal, born 1923, is Emeritus Professor for UCL Geography.

They share an enthusiasm for the fabrication process as it relates to the built world both physically and poetically by letting the properties, limitations, and economic scenarios associated with a process guide a structure’s ultimate form while developing methods to extend the intertwined boundaries of aesthetics, physical performance and lifecycle.Speculation and execution are inexorably linked in the work; each project demands tight control over design and production. As young practitioners, this requires a do-it-yourself ethos. Consequently, the practice has 'designed' the work in order to be able to exploit opportunities to build that are outside the constraints of the conventional architectural milieu. Although the projects are experimental with respect to production, they are far more than prototypes; each directly addresses human occupation by enhancing and celebrating social interaction through sensation, spectacle and physical engagement.Ball-Nogues has exhibited at major institutions throughout the world, including the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles;  the Guggenheim Museum; PS1; arc en rêve centre d'architecture + Musée d'Art Contemporain de Bordeaux; the Venice Biennale, the Hong Kong | Shenzhen Biennale; and the Beijing Biennale. They have received numerous honours including three AIA Design Awards, United States Artists Target Fellowships and a grant from the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts. In 2007 the Studio was the winner of the Museum of Modern Arts PS1 Young Architects Program Competition. Their work is in the permanent collection of MoMA. In 2011 they were one of the Architectural League of New York's Emerging Voices. The partners have taught in the graduate architecture programmes at universities in the USA. Their work has appeared in a variety of publications worldwide.BENJAMIN BALL grew up in Colorado and Iowa where his mother’s involvement in theatre proved influential. While studying for his degree at the Southern California Institute of Architecture, Ball logged stints at Gehry Partners and Shirdel Zago Kipnis. Upon graduation, he sought work as a set and production designer for films (including the Matrix series) as well as music videos and commercials with directors including Mark Romanek and Tony Scott. His experience ranges from work on the Disney Concert Hall and small residential commissions for boutique firms to complex medical structures and event design.",

        "detail": "The lecture is organised around a series of statements that articulate contradictory accounts of the relationship between maps and territories. The entry point is the title of a novel by Michel Houellebecq, La carte et le territoire (2010). Commentators of Houellebecq’s controversial narrative, in which an artist achieves fame thanks to huge photographic reproductions of fragments of Michelin road maps, have remarked upon the obvious allusion to Alfred Korzybski’s dictum 'the map is not the territory'.  Korzybski, founder of the discipline of General Semantic (that acquired popularity in architectural circles immediately after WWII), publicly formulated the statement for the first time in 1931 to summarised the central thesis of his philosophy, i.e. that the concept of a thing or our reaction to a thing are not the thing itself. In the case of maps and territories, according to Korzybski, models of the real are mistaken for the real itself. Korzybski’s propositions were re-visited by anthropologist-cyberneticist Gregory Bateson in 'Form, Substance, and Difference', an essay published in Steps to an Ecology of the Mind (1972). In this text,  after emphasising the validity of Korzybski statement, Bateson affirms: 'We know the territory does not get on to the map [ …] What gets on to the map, in fact, is difference, be it a difference in altitude, a difference in vegetation, a difference in population structure, difference in surface or whatever […] But what is a difference? A difference is a very peculiar and obscure concept. It is certainly not a thing or an event[…].' More recently (2003), in an essay devoted to recent developments in mapping technology, Denis Cosgrove, evoking Jorge Louis Borges well known tale about the map at the scale of an Empire, wrote: 'the only true map is the territory itself'.  Finally, the title of a provisional version of an article by Bruno Latour, Valérie November and Eduardo Camacho-Hübner (2010), that proposes a navigational as opposed to mimetic interpretation of maps, dramatically stated that 'the territory is the map'. The lecture will attempt to map such puzzling and thorny issues.",

The price of energy and food is climbing, unemployment remains high, the housing market has tanked, consumer and government debt is soaring, and the recovery is slowing. The prospect of a second collapse of the global economy leaves humanity desperate for a sustainable economic game plan for the future.\nIn his book, The Third Industrial Revolution (forthcoming 2011), Rifkin describes how the five-pillars of the Third Industrial Revolution will create innumerable businesses and jobs, and usher in a fundamental reordering of human relationships, from hierarchical to lateral power, that will impact on the conduct of business, governance, education and civic life.\nJeremy Rifkin is president and founder of the Foundation on Economic Trends and the author of many books on the impact of scientific and technological changes on the economy, the workforce, society, and the environment. He is the principal architect of the European Union’s Third Industrial Revolution long-term economic sustainability plan, which was formally endorsed by the European Parliament in 2007 and is now being implemented by agencies within the European Commission as well as in the 27 member-states.\nThe lecture will be broadcast live into the street, accompanying the Diploma 18 projection – see below.\nRead Jeremy Rifkin’s article: ‘Only An Energy Internet Can Ward Off Disaster’ (FT 10.5.2010)\n \nFollowed by:Diploma 18 Projection Monday 7 November, 7.30 facade of 32 to 39 Bedford Square Stunning projections created by Diploma 18, led by Enric Ruiz-Geli, across the entire facade of the school will show how the AA – and other businesses, homes and people – can rethink the future of power generation, their role in society, work and the city.

        "detail": "Green roofs, artificial mountains and geological forms; buildings you walk on or over; networks of ramps and warped surfaces; buildings that carve into the ground or landscapes lifted high into the air: all these are commonplace in architecture today. New technologies, new design techniques and a demand for enhanced environmental performance have provoked a rethinking of architecture’s traditional relationship to the ground. Some of today’s most innovative buildings no longer occupy a given site but instead, construct the site itself. Landform Building examines the many manifestations of landscape and ecology in contemporary architectural practice: not as a cross-disciplinary phenomenon (architects working in the landscape) but as new design techniques, new formal strategies and technical problems within architecture.  Stan Allen is an architect working in New York and dean of the School of Architecture at Princeton University. He holds degrees from Brown University, The Cooper Union and Princeton. He has taught at Harvard, Columbia and Princeton, and his architectural firm SAA/Stan Allen Architect has realised buildings and urban projects in the US, South America and Asia. Responding to the complexity of the modern city in creative ways, Stan Allen has developed an extensive catalogue of innovative design strategies, in particular looking at field theory, landscape architecture and ecology as models to revitalise the practices of urban design. In 2008 he received a P/A Award for the Taichung Gateway Park and a Faith and Form Award for the CCV Chapel; in 2009 he received a P/A Award for the Yan-Ping Waterfront in Taipei, an AIA Award for the CCV Chapel, the John Q Hejduk Award, and an Academy Award in Architecture from the American Academy of Arts and Letters; in 2010, his building for Paju Book City in Korea received an AIA Award. In 2011, the Taichung InfoBox was recognised with a P/A Award, and AIA Awards from New York City, New York state and the Tri-State Region. In addition to numerous articles and project reviews, his architectural work is published in Points + Lines: Diagrams and Projects for the City, (Princeton Architectural Press 2001) and his essays in Practice: Architecture, Technique and Representation (Routledge, 2008). His most recent book is the edited volume Landform Building: Architecture’s New Terrain, Published by Lars Müller in 2011.",

        "detail": "The lecture will be followed by drinks to celebrate the launch of the issue of AD jointly edited by FAT and Charles Jencks.Radical Post-Modernism, edited by Charles Jencks and FAT (Sean Griffiths, Charles Holland and Sam Jacob) marks the resurgence of a critical architecture that engages in a far-reaching way with issues of taste, space, character and ornament. Bridging high and low cultures, it immerses itself in the age of information, embracing meaning and communication, embroiling itself in the dirty politics of taste by drawing ideas from beyond the narrow confines ofarchitecture. It is a multi-dimensional, amorphous category, which is heavily influenced by contemporary art, cultural theory, modern literature and everyday life. This edition of AD demonstrates how, in the age of late capitalism, Radical Post-Modernism can provide an architecture of resistance and contemporary relevance.www.fat.co.ukwww.strangeharvest.com",

        "detail": "On 18 October 2002 Jason Griffiths and Alex Gino set out to explore the American suburbs. Over 178 days they drove 22,383 miles, made 134 suburban house calls and took 2,593 photographs.In Manifest Destiny, Griffiths reveals the results of this exploration. Structured through 58 short chapters, the anthology offers an architectural pattern book of suburban conditions all focused not on the unique or specific but the placeless. These chapters are complemented by an introduction by Griffiths and an afterword by Swiss architectural historian Martino Stierli.Manifest Destiny is a lecture about the contradictory dream of manufactured suburban America.  It presents a first hand account of ordinary houses first photographed in 2003 during a road trip across the US. Today this has grown into book of images and thoughts that present a compromised view of a bucolic world full of perfect homes. And yet despite this abject and at times empty picture Manifest Destinyalso suggest a place of tragic beauty and the enduring, strange allure of the Arcadian dream.\nJason Griffiths is a partner in Gino Griffiths architects and works in the American Southwest. His practice is based on a multidisciplinary approach to architecture working through competitions, buildings, furniture, writing and photography. He has won numerous international awards and has exhibited and published widely including in AA Files, Architecture, JA, JAE and the Sunday Times. Built work includes The Lowest House in the Mojave Desert, Siouxland Transit Bus Stops, K-Zell Metalworks, The Political Ply Shade Canopy and Scottsdale Arts Camera Obscura. Jason has lectured widely throughout Europe, the US and Mexico and has taught at the Bartlett, Westminster, the AA and the Tech de Monterrey. http:///www.ginogriffiths.com",

Through the lens of these two events we will re-examine our preservationist and conservationist attitudes toward the natural world and spin tales of the ecologically fragile and the technologically obsolete.To be the first to enter the cosmos, to engage, single-handed, in an unprecedented duel with nature-could one dream of anything more!Yuri Gagarin 1100 UNKNOWN FIELDS <http://www.unknownfieldsdivision.com/>  INTRO by LIAM YOUNG <http://www.tomorrowsthoughtstoday.com/>  andKATE DAVIES <http://www.liquidfactory.co.uk/> 1120 THE ATOMICMICHAEL MADSEN <http://www.intoeternitythemovie.com/>  [film maker]Film maker Michael Madsen will be traveling with the Unknown Fields Division on our Chenobyl to Baikonur project. Michael directed  the recent documentary Into Eternity, which tells the story of the Onkolo Nuclear Waste Repository in Finland, a facility that must remain intact for 100,000 years even though no structure in human history has even stood for such a long period of time. The film addresses an audience in the remote future and questions Onkolo’s eternal existence and its legacy as a reminder of this toxic energy source. MARIO PETRUCCI <http://www.mariopetrucci.com/heavywater.htm>  [poet]Originally a Natural Sciences graduate with a PhD in optoelectronics, Mario Petrucci works as a freelance creative writing tutor, broadcaster and educator. Mario has published a book-length poem on the Chernobyl didaster titled Heavy Water. Petrucci takes up the challenge confronting society in every age: to attempt the difficult task of exploring its most terrible events. His poem unites the concerns of artist, humanitarian and historian at a common source: the desire not to forget. Heavy Water exists to remind us that those who have been exposed to the invisible should never become so. CORNELIA HESSE HONEGGER <http://www.wissenskunst.ch/en/tschernobyl.htm>  [scientific illustrator]Cornelia Hesse Honegger is a scientific illustrator and science artist. For 25 years she worked as a scientific illustrator for the scientific department of the Natural History Museum at the University of Zurich. Her watercolours are exhibited internationally at museums and galleries. Her work is at the interface of art and science; it plays witness to a beautiful but endangered nature. Since the catastrophe of Chernobyl in 1986, she has collected, studied and painted morphologically disturbed insects, which she finds in the fallout areas of Chernobyl as well as near nuclear installations. PETER WYNN KIRBY <http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/japans-long-nuclear-disaster-film/>  [environmental anthropologist ]Peter Wynn Kirby is an ‘environmental anthropologist’ and researcher with the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at Oxford. In his latest book, Troubled Natures: Waste, Environment, Japan, he considers experiences of nuclear risk and national/cultural constructions of energy, power, pollution, and waste in Japan and in France – the two major nations that depend most on nuclear power, yet where the risks and benefits of nuclear power play out over vastly different sociocultural topographies. WILL WILES <http://willwiles.blogspot.com/> [author/journalist]Will WIles is deputy editor of the architecture and design journal Icon and has recently completed his debut novel Care of Wooden Floors, a black comedy about a man being driven insane by minimalist interior decoration. Through the Unknown Fields project he will be developing a new book titled Toxic Tourism which will be published by Harper Press in mid 2012 STEPHAN TRÜBY <http://www.exit-limited.com/>  [architect/curator]Dr Stephan Trüby (b. 1970) is an architect, theoretician and curator. He was Professor of Architecture at Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design and has published such books as 5 Codes: Architecture, Paranoia and Risk in Times of Terror,  Exit-Architecture: Design between War and Peace and Hertzianism: Electromagnetism in Architecture, Design and Art. PHILIPS DESIGN PROBES <http://www.design.philips.com/probes/index.page>  [technology designers]Philips Design Probes is a dedicated ‘far-future’ research initiative to track trends and developments across the realms of politics, economics, culture, environments and technology. With the aim of understanding ‘lifestyle’ post-2020, the program aims to identify probable systemic shifts and challenges conventional ways of thinking about technology to come up with concepts, products and narratives to stimulate debate. Phillips is a primary project sponsor and has provided a number of scholarships for emerging artists to join the Unknown Fields Chernobyl to Baikonur Cosmodrome studio. 1400 THE COSMICALICIA FRAMIS <http://moon-life.org/store/>  [artist]Director of Moon Life Foundation, Alicia Framis speculates on the possibility that humans will live in space in the future. The project acts as a stimulus for artists, designers, architects to create futuristic radical political but humane concepts for an extreme lunar environment. Alicia Framis is also exploring the potentialities of living on the moon through the ironical activities and fictional character of a woman astronaut. Left on earth like all women who were never part of the moon race, she settles in to BaseCamp, in which she lived for the two weeks in a customised astronaut suit, among drawings and prototypes that aim to both parody and demand women’s presence on the moon. REGINA PLEDSZUS <http://www.spaceflightdesign.org/>  [space human factors designer ]Regina’s research investigates the emotional and environmental implications of manned spaceflight and particularly the psychological challenges of isolation and monotony for crew during extended exploration missions to Mars or Near Earth Asteroids. Her research has developed into conceptual and applied input into the habitability design aspects of ground-based mission simulations like the Mars 500 experiment and the generation of mission ideas with the European Space Agency’s Advanced Concepts Team. Recently Regina has recently been based in the Stanley Kubrick archive exploring speculative design in science fiction and the real-world applicability of sci-fi film sets as scenarios for psychological habitability. PAUL DUFFIELD <http://www.spoonbard.com/>  [comic creator/illustrator]Paul Duffield is a comic book creator, animator and illustrator. He collaborates with author Warren Ellis on the webcomic Freakangels and the visual poem Signal, an experiment in visual storytelling that attempts to use comicbook visual language to explore the the theme of the human search for knowledge and other life, inspired by SETI, and Carl Sagan’s series Cosmos. After countless decades  scanning the skies, listening to the beep beep beep from alien worlds there is just one man left in the SETI institute, still waiting … LOUISE K WILSON <http://www.lkwilson.org/>  [sound artist ] Louise K Wilson is a visual artist who makes installations, live works, sound works and single-channel videos. Her current research uses the medium of sound to ask philosophical and material questions about the spatio-temporal physicality of certain sites and our perceptions of them. She has travelled to numerous military and scientific sites including the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training facility, nuclear submarines, US listening stations, university halls, rocket launch sites and disused RAF bases in pursuit of the acoustics of resonant spaces. She has explored the ways in which technologies of the audible create new ways of engaging with the lost traces of institutional places. NELLY BEN HAYOUN <http://www.nellyben.com/>  [experience designer]Nelly Ben Hayoun has designed experiences for you to become an astronaut in the living room, generating dark energy from pigeons’ eggs in the kitchen and colliding atoms in the bathroom. She is interested in how we can use design and science in our everyday lives to make them more thrilling, creative and passionate. Often science seems to be reserved for scientists – expert practitioners who alone have the privilege of experiencing the fringes of human knowledge and the extremes of nature. Her work aims to combat this aspect of science, by enlisting willing scientists in experiences that mix the creativity with technology, science with fiction, factual with artistic and amateur with expert. MARK PILKINGTON <http://www.miragemen.com/>  [UFO folklorist]Mark Pilkington is a writer, publisher, curator and musician with particular interest in the fringes of knowledge, culture and belief. On a journey through the badlands and backwaters of America, Mark Pilkington uncovered a 60-year-old story stranger than any conspiracy thriller. Through the fascinating account of his travels Pilkington reveals the long history of UFOria and its origins in the murky worlds of espionage, psychological warfare and UFO hunters, Pilkington soon discovers that the truth about flying saucers is stranger and more complex than either the ufologists or debunkers would have us believe: instead of covering-up stories of crashed spacecraft, alien contacts and secret underground bases, the US intelligence agenciesTHE UNKNOWN FIELDS DIVISION IS SUPPORTED BY PHILIPS DESIGN PROBES <http://www.design.philips.com/probes/index.page>  [technology designers]KUMUKA WORLDWIDE <http://www.kumuka.co.uk/>  [adventure travel consultants]UKRAINE INTERNATIONAL AIRLINES <http://www.flyuia.com/eng/uk.html>  [project carrier]VOLUME <http://volumeproject.org/>  [research lab ]NEASDEN CONTROL CENTRE <http://www.neasdencontrolcentre.com/>  [graphic artist ] ",

His poem unites the concerns of artist, humanitarian and historian at a common source: the desire not to forget. Heavy Water exists to remind us that those who have been exposed to the invisible should never become so. CORNELIA HESSE HONEGGER <http://www.wissenskunst.ch/en/tschernobyl.htm>  [scientific illustrator]Cornelia Hesse Honegger is a scientific illustrator and science artist. For 25 years she worked as a scientific illustrator for the scientific department of the Natural History Museum at the University of Zurich. Her watercolours are exhibited internationally at museums and galleries. Her work is at the interface of art and science; it plays witness to a beautiful but endangered nature. Since the catastrophe of Chernobyl in 1986, she has collected, studied and painted morphologically disturbed insects, which she finds in the fallout areas of Chernobyl as well as near nuclear installations. PETER WYNN KIRBY <http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/japans-long-nuclear-disaster-film/>  [environmental anthropologist ]Peter Wynn Kirby is an ‘environmental anthropologist’ and researcher with the Institute of Social and Cultural Anthropology at Oxford. In his latest book, Troubled Natures: Waste, Environment, Japan, he considers experiences of nuclear risk and national/cultural constructions of energy, power, pollution, and waste in Japan and in France – the two major nations that depend most on nuclear power, yet where the risks and benefits of nuclear power play out over vastly different sociocultural topographies. WILL WILES <http://willwiles.blogspot.com/> [author/journalist]Will WIles is deputy editor of the architecture and design journal Icon and has recently completed his debut novel Care of Wooden Floors, a black comedy about a man being driven insane by minimalist interior decoration.

The project acts as a stimulus for artists, designers, architects to create futuristic radical political but humane concepts for an extreme lunar environment. Alicia Framis is also exploring the potentialities of living on the moon through the ironical activities and fictional character of a woman astronaut. Left on earth like all women who were never part of the moon race, she settles in to BaseCamp, in which she lived for the two weeks in a customised astronaut suit, among drawings and prototypes that aim to both parody and demand women’s presence on the moon. REGINA PLEDSZUS <http://www.spaceflightdesign.org/>  [space human factors designer ]Regina’s research investigates the emotional and environmental implications of manned spaceflight and particularly the psychological challenges of isolation and monotony for crew during extended exploration missions to Mars or Near Earth Asteroids. Her research has developed into conceptual and applied input into the habitability design aspects of ground-based mission simulations like the Mars 500 experiment and the generation of mission ideas with the European Space Agency’s Advanced Concepts Team. Recently Regina has recently been based in the Stanley Kubrick archive exploring speculative design in science fiction and the real-world applicability of sci-fi film sets as scenarios for psychological habitability. PAUL DUFFIELD <http://www.spoonbard.com/>  [comic creator/illustrator]Paul Duffield is a comic book creator, animator and illustrator. He collaborates with author Warren Ellis on the webcomic Freakangels and the visual poem Signal, an experiment in visual storytelling that attempts to use comicbook visual language to explore the the theme of the human search for knowledge and other life, inspired by SETI, and Carl Sagan’s series Cosmos.

Her current research uses the medium of sound to ask philosophical and material questions about the spatio-temporal physicality of certain sites and our perceptions of them. She has travelled to numerous military and scientific sites including the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training facility, nuclear submarines, US listening stations, university halls, rocket launch sites and disused RAF bases in pursuit of the acoustics of resonant spaces. She has explored the ways in which technologies of the audible create new ways of engaging with the lost traces of institutional places. NELLY BEN HAYOUN <http://www.nellyben.com/>  [experience designer]Nelly Ben Hayoun has designed experiences for you to become an astronaut in the living room, generating dark energy from pigeons’ eggs in the kitchen and colliding atoms in the bathroom. She is interested in how we can use design and science in our everyday lives to make them more thrilling, creative and passionate. Often science seems to be reserved for scientists – expert practitioners who alone have the privilege of experiencing the fringes of human knowledge and the extremes of nature. Her work aims to combat this aspect of science, by enlisting willing scientists in experiences that mix the creativity with technology, science with fiction, factual with artistic and amateur with expert. MARK PILKINGTON <http://www.miragemen.com/>  [UFO folklorist]Mark Pilkington is a writer, publisher, curator and musician with particular interest in the fringes of knowledge, culture and belief.

The project acts as a stimulus for artists, designers, architects to create futuristic radical political but humane concepts for an extreme lunar environment. Alicia Framis is also exploring the potentialities of living on the moon through the ironical activities and fictional character of a woman astronaut. Left on earth like all women who were never part of the moon race, she settles in to BaseCamp, in which she lived for the two weeks in a customised astronaut suit, among drawings and prototypes that aim to both parody and demand women’s presence on the moon. REGINA PLEDSZUS <http://www.spaceflightdesign.org/>  [space human factors designer ]Regina’s research investigates the emotional and environmental implications of manned spaceflight and particularly the psychological challenges of isolation and monotony for crew during extended exploration missions to Mars or Near Earth Asteroids. Her research has developed into conceptual and applied input into the habitability design aspects of ground-based mission simulations like the Mars 500 experiment and the generation of mission ideas with the European Space Agency’s Advanced Concepts Team. Recently Regina has recently been based in the Stanley Kubrick archive exploring speculative design in science fiction and the real-world applicability of sci-fi film sets as scenarios for psychological habitability. PAUL DUFFIELD <http://www.spoonbard.com/>  [comic creator/illustrator]Paul Duffield is a comic book creator, animator and illustrator.

Her current research uses the medium of sound to ask philosophical and material questions about the spatio-temporal physicality of certain sites and our perceptions of them. She has travelled to numerous military and scientific sites including the Yuri Gagarin Cosmonaut Training facility, nuclear submarines, US listening stations, university halls, rocket launch sites and disused RAF bases in pursuit of the acoustics of resonant spaces. She has explored the ways in which technologies of the audible create new ways of engaging with the lost traces of institutional places. NELLY BEN HAYOUN <http://www.nellyben.com/>  [experience designer]Nelly Ben Hayoun has designed experiences for you to become an astronaut in the living room, generating dark energy from pigeons’ eggs in the kitchen and colliding atoms in the bathroom. She is interested in how we can use design and science in our everyday lives to make them more thrilling, creative and passionate. Often science seems to be reserved for scientists – expert practitioners who alone have the privilege of experiencing the fringes of human knowledge and the extremes of nature. Her work aims to combat this aspect of science, by enlisting willing scientists in experiences that mix the creativity with technology, science with fiction, factual with artistic and amateur with expert. MARK PILKINGTON <http://www.miragemen.com/>  [UFO folklorist]Mark Pilkington is a writer, publisher, curator and musician with particular interest in the fringes of knowledge, culture and belief.

        "detail": "Literal Transcription:MARINA LATHOURI: Now, I would like to introduce our first speaker, Mario Carpo, who is an architectural historian, who has extensively written and researched the relationships between architectural theory, information technology, media, and technologies of architectural representation. Mario is currently professor at the Georgia institute of technology, and also Vincent Scully visiting professor of architectural history at Yale University. Before that, he was visiting professor at a number of European and American Universities, and also a visiting scholar at the American Academy in Rome, at the Getty Research Institute, and at the Clark Art Institute. Mario was also head of the studies at the CCA, Montreal, between 2002 and 2005, he has written and published extensively, his most recent publication is ‘The Alphabet and the Algorithm’ (released last week), ‘Architecture in the Age of Printing’ (2001), a commentary on Leon Battista Alberti’s Descriptio Urbis Romae, and also he has written and published a number of essays on architectural representation, which have been published in various magazines, such as Perspectives, Projections and Design, the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Log, Grey Room, Architecture D'Aujourd'hui, Arquitectura Viva, Architectural Design, and so on. The title of his talk is ‘Tell, Don’t Show: On Scripting and Scribing and the Almost Inevitable Demise of Digital Images.’MARIO CARPO: Thank you, Marina for the generous introduction. I received a title—Writing and Critical Thinking in Architecture—and an assignment for this talk: to articulate the role of writing in the realm of contemporary architecture and culture. I would like to start from a particular, specific aspect of the matter, just a little thing, a technicality, almost, but one which I think it is crucial to our understanding of the present time and revelatory of the major shift, now underway, in the media at our disposal, to write about architecture. I would like to consider, briefly, the relationship, that we, architectural writers, entertain with architectural illustrations—the topic was already mentioned, of course—with the images that are meant to accompany our writings. To accompany, I say: that might not be the right word. Companionship implies some mutual affection, and any architectural writer knows that the relationship between our texts and images is often not so friendly. How many times are we asked by publishers, or editors, to eliminate pictures which we think we need, or to add images we do not need? And we will argue: our readers will never, ever need. Yet publishers or editors have the last word on this. How many times we would desperately need images, which we cannot publish because of the insurmountable amount of copyright issues. We all have—I presume—horror stories we could tell on this—I have some myself, which I should keep for the coffee break. Yet this tyranny of architectural images of the copyright orders is in historical terms only a recent development. There were no coffee table books in the Middle ages, and no illustrated magazines in Classical antiquity. Cicero’s wife, I think her name was Terentia, did not read Architectural Digest. In fact, from the beginning of historical times and until the sixteenth century, images of architecture were an absolute rarity. There were not many of them around, and no wonder those that did exist were so lousy, that there was not much to do with them anyway. For most of our collective past, until the Renaissance, architecture evidently existed, but architecture images did not. This may suggest that architecture can exist without the mediation of images. And, as architecture could do without images so often in the past, well, perhaps it could do without images again in the future. And, I would argue, it just might. The modern power of images, including architectural images, started, only in the Renaissance. With the almost concommital invention of two cultural technologies, that seem to be made for one another. Geometrical perspective, as defined by Leon Battista Alberti, and printmaking. Around 1435, Alberti’s geometrical perspective defined perspectival images as the indexical trace left by beams or rays of light onto a physical surface, the picture plane. (Shows the very famous interpretation by Albrecht Dürer). Alberti’s book, of course, had no illustrations at all, which is a bit strange for a book which is about perspective. The technical term Alberti used in this context, was actually not a beam of light, but a rocket. In Alberti’s theory, visual beams are rockets that hit the picture plane, and when they do, the impact leaves a trace. (Shows another interpretation, also by Albrecht Dürer, where the ‘rockets’ have been replaced by strings and it is possible to see the intersection of the string with the picture plane: where it hits, it leaves a mark). It would be hard, even for Peter Eisenman, to imagine something more indexical than that. More or less at the same time, drawings started in turn to be printed, using mechanical matrixes; woodcuts or metal plates, just as this woodcut (shown) by Albrecht Dürer, of the date of 1525. Then, as now, all imprints of the same matrix look the same, always the same and the same for all. This started in the Renaissance: the geometrical indexicality of perspectival images was multiplied by the mechanical indexicality of print. Both perspective and print recorded and transmitted indexical visual traces, the mark left by a beam of light on a picture plane, or the stamp left by a printer’s plate on a piece of paper. And, sure enough, a bit later—actually, 404 years after Alberti invented geometrical perspective, photography multiplied the power of perspectival images, because photographic images are machine-made perspectives, where the physical traces of light are not laboriously reconstructed by the hand of a painter, but automatically recorded by technology. If Alberti could have seen a photographic image, well…how much he would have liked it. Perspective, print, and photography: all these technologies, together, created the power of modern images. The power of the image’s trustworthiness, the power of proof. When an image is photographed, and or when a photograph is printed, an indexical chain traces the image back to the matrix, from which it was printed or to the archetype, which it represents. If something occurs in a photograph, it must have occurred in real life. Photographic pictures, just like Alberti’s perspectival images, are automatic imprints of reality. They are indexical images of nature itself. But digital images do not work that way. The geometry, whereby a picture is captured, in a digital camera, for instance, has not changed, but the technology whereby pictures are recorded and transmitted digitally, has changed very much. Digital images, as the name indicates, are recorded and transmitted as files: they are first digitized, meaning, translated into numbers, by sampling and quantization, this numbers are then stored, retrieved and sent around at will. At some later point, this strings of numbers, may or may not be reconverted into a visual picture. When this happens, all kind of things can happen, but in most cases without and outside the control of the maker of the original picture. An example with which we can all be familiar: if we send an illustrated postcard, a good, old, traditional printed postcard to one hundred friends, each friend will receive the same picture, and will see the same picture on that postcard. But, if we email the same picture to 100 friends, as a jpg attachment, for example, each recipient will most likely see a different picture. And variations, as always in the digital domain, may occur randomly, or by design, or by the unpredictable intervention of some external entity, actor or network, as Bruno Latour would say. Digital images drift, every instantiation, every manifestation, every occurrence or epiphany of the same digital file, is a different even, and one that the maker of the original picture can neither control, nor anticipate. And, as digital pictures inevitably drift, because that is inherent in their very technical nature, they inevitably cheat. Digital images can no longer be held as true to reality. The indexical chain that used to link photographic images to the event which they represented has been broken by digital technology. In the case of old good photographic pictures, editing and post-production were the exception. In the case of digital pictures, editing and post-production are the rule. All digital pictures are inevitably post-processed, at some point, by someone, or even when we chose to do nothing at all, by technology itself. Yes, old photographic photomontages could cheat, and they did. They could cheat, precisely, because we expected old photographic images to be true to reality, but today, all digital images are, in a sense, photomontages. And today all images are digital, at least at some point in their course of their life as images. Hence, the conclusion is simple, and drastic: today all images cheat. They can have no documental value, whatsoever. The visual and social consequences of this drastic demotion of the ontological status of digital images, from indexical realism to nothing, or almost nothing, are momentous. Some consequences, have already been felt, also in the daily practice of our trade. I presume we are all familiar with the all too common predicament of the architectural critic, that it has to sift through an endless cornucopia of images, which might be documental photographs of existing buildings, or digital renderings of non-existing buildings, or anything in between, and there is no way to tell. Just as an example, if you open any architectural magazine today and you see an image (shown), you could think that this building does not exist, but then you turn the page and you think that the building shown does exist, because it has even the Eiffel tower in the background. However, in this case the first one does not, it never did, and never will. Sometimes even the captions—when there are some—are deliberately reticent or misleading, and the only way to know if the building that is represented in pictures exists in reality is to check it out in google earth, or go to see it in person, or ask a friend who lives there. And, of course, even the satellite pictures assembled by Google Earth can cheat, just in the same way, and, in fact, I presume they do, when they bear on some special or ‘sensitive’ sites. Some have argued, with some reason, that digital technologies by multiplying images, are facilitating their transmission, extending their functions and uses, are in fact increasing the modern power of images. This is a theory which has its proponents, which I cannot discuss here, but that might be the case, it might be true that in some scientific fields, where digital visualizations are indeed changing the way some scientists engineers, or even surgeons or dentists, for example, work. We have seen that dentists are increasing digital images, that doesn’t make me feel very safe, for the same reason I’m arguing, but let’s cross fingers. In general, in our visual culture, as well as in architectural representations, I would argue that the open ended, uncontrollable mutability of the digital imaging is in fact reducing, not increasing, their ambits of use. This is because, as I was saying, today’s images are no longer any intrinsic value of proof. To retain some of their old trustworthiness, digital images must be validated, or certified in a sense, by some external agency, by the authority of the major or publisher, someone who stands behind the image as the only guarantor of their meaning. And even in that case, that might not always work, this is a famous case study, [shows slide] this is evidently the same picture of the same person, but it is not really the same picture; the picture on the right (if you) go down form the shoulders to the pants, and you see it is a straight line; on the left, at some point, there is a taurus, like a doric column. And the picture on the right was published by all the French media, the picture on the left was published by all the American media. [Audience laughter]. Now, the International Herald Tribune, which is published in Paris, but it’s owned by the New York Times, published both. Now, we cannot tell who was cheating, but evidently one of the two parties was cheating. You multiply this by a factor of one billion, and this may lead to a distrust of digital images, which is not unlike that which prevailed for centuries before the rise of perspective, print, and photography. And which was famously epitomised in the seventh century, by Isidore of Seville: “Pictura quasi fictura (…)” “Pictures are cheat, they are never trustworthy, never true to reality.” That was indeed the case, in the seventh century, whenever non geometrical images where handmade, copied, and transmitted by scribes. Before the invention of printed images, each such image was always at the mercy of the wills of each individual copyist. And oddly, this is increasingly the case today, due to the unlimited variability of machine made, but randomly variable, digital pictures. Images held sway, in the modern age of mechanical making, when photographic images were framed, frozen, authorial recordings of sight. Today’s digital images are a permanently drifting, often anonymous, or unauthorised, mashed up, snippets and snapshots, bereft of any indexical value. Evidently, we can no longer use images as we use to, and one may well wonder if we can use images at all, in this technical context. A small aside: this is not our subject today, but let’s note in passing, that the same tradition from frozen, visual documents, to dynamic generative scripts, has already eliminated another category of images that use to be central to the making of Modern architecture: notational drawings, such as blueprints, construction drawings, images which were meant to show workers how to actually make things. Most such notational drawings or images, are now being replaced by digital information models, and parametric variability is the design logic embedded in most of today’s digital tools for CAD and CAM. In computer-based design and publication, most notational images are replaced by flexible, ruled-based, generative scripts, and in these instances too, individual images are fast becoming irrelevant, because they are increasingly seen only as the occasional and ephemeral spin-off or epiphany or manifestation of the script used to generate them. In many CAD-CAM integrated systems, notational drawings are in fact no longer needed, and they are no longer used, because objects can be fabricated directly out of a digital file. In the new digital paradigm, the parametric script, which can generate families of images and objects alike, is everything. Each individually generated image counts for little, or nothing. And, with a certain symmetry, just as technical and notational images in architectural design are being replaced by algorithmic scripting, pictorial and representational images in architectural discourse, may be replaced by alphabetic scribing: parametric scripting can actually generate images, whereas alphabetic scribing can only evoque the scribe or suggest some of them, but in both cases, the logic is the same, both the alphabet and the algorithm can replace images without providing any ready made picture. In fact, I would argue, this is precisely the reason why today we so crucially need words, narration, interpretation, instead of images. Because, such is the nature of today digital images, that we know that we can no longer trust images. Hence, we can no longer read the information they provide. An image use to be worth a thousand words, but today a few words can make more sense than a thousand pictures. In the course of the last fifteen years, the transition from analogue drawing to digital scripting has changed architectural design. Today, the same transition form image to scribing or describing is already changing the landscape of architectural publications. Some of the most innovative, of recent crop, of architectural journals, such as Log in the United States, Criticat in France—and when I wrote this, I did not know that the inventor would be in the room today—or Candide in Germany have deliberately opted for an almost un-iconic format, one that prompts writers to write, and readers to read. Apparently, some architectural writers and publishers have already concluded that there is no point in spending money to publish additional images, when there are already so many of them available everywhere, online for example, and each of them worth so little. Now, let’s have a look again at these three covers [slide] on these three covers, we only find letters and numbers, and it is not a coincidence. Additional evidence: in the course of the last few months, a conference in Portugal [slide], an issue of AD (Architectural Design) [slide], and an exhibition at the CCA [slide], and when I wrote this I didn’t know that the co-curator would be in this room. They have all tackled various aspects of narrativity, of or anti-iconicity, in contemporary architectural writing, and I could also mention, as additional evidence, the website of one of today’s—I think—most interesting star-architects [showing website of Valerio Olgiati] a website which does not show a single image of any building whatsoever. I’m telling that because you may go and click and check the website and think that part of it is offline. That’s all there is, there is nothing else, you can click on the plus, which means “more,” and you see something meaning “less,” and you go back to the main page. Now, all this, and many other evidence could be added, in my opinion, means something: it means that the demise of the image may be in the making, or at least in the air. The age of the mechanical reproducible image is over, and instead, a new art of scripting and scribing, appears to be rising. The alphabet and the algorithm, narrational computation, are today’s tools. The alphabet and the algorithm make for a good match, they are made for one another, and they are well together, just as perspective and print are intertwined in the Renaissance. Computers have killed the iconic image, and the search of iconicity we are seeing now, in many ways, of life and art, may well be this one song of a techno-cultural environment, on its way to extinction. Our postmodern digital future will most likely be logocentric and logico-centric discourse and computation. This, of course, does not mean the end of visuality, we still will have eyes to see, but our ways of seeing are changing, just as our visual environment is changing in a way that is unparalleled in Modern history. The alphabet and the algorithm are evidently not universal tools, and we shall always need plenty of images of all sorts, but there is no way to go back to the history of iconoclasm, to remark, as many already have, that images can often cheat and numb our senses, but script is always a compliment, and a complement to our intellect.Transcription by María José Orihuela, Architect, MA HCT at the Architectural Association.Organised by Marina LathouriAt a time of rapid technological change and a pervasive global intelligence, where greater numbers of new books, magazines and journals – in print and online – are being published, this event aims to look at different approaches to writing in and about architecture.

        "detail": "Organised by Marina LathouriAt a time of rapid technological  change and a pervasive global intelligence, where greater numbers of new  books, magazines and journals – in print and online – are being  published, this event aims to look at different approaches to writing in  and about architecture. The aim is to articulate the role of writing in  the realm of contemporary architecture and culture and in  reformulations of practice. Participants reflect upon the possibility of  criticism in these new modes of production of architectural knowledge.This  enquiry into writing and architecture began with a series of seminars  in the autumn, exploring writing from the various yet overlapping  standpoints of author, editor, critic and journalist and examining  intersections with visual art/design practice.Schedule10.00 Nasrine Seraji, architect, Director, Ecole d’Architecture Paris-Malaquais, DAZIBAO d’Architectures; Reading ArchitectureYves Lomax, Goldsmiths, Beginning, Ends and Middles Jane Rendell, The Bartlett School of Architecture, Site-Writing12.30 Lunch1.30 Mario Carpo, Georgia Institute of Technology/Yale UniversityMarina Lathouri, AA School, Writing as Architecture2.30 Hannes Mayer, Archithese, To the Root: the changing relevance of thoroughnessGiovanna Borasi, CCAJoseph Grima, Domus, Collaborative Criticism: magazines in the era of 140-character debate4.30 Discussion5.30 Drinks    For further details, please contact Marina Lathouri, Director, MA History and Critical Thinking / PhD at marina.lathouri@aaschool.ac.uk",

        "detail": "Architecture and design face many dilemmas; probably the most serious is the inherent inability to effectively deal with reality. Architecture and design have lost touch with the everyday and its politics. If we would learn to accept the dynamic and incomprehensible conflicts between actualities, desires and practices structuring reality, we could also accept that architecture and design are not able to produce any homogenising, settling, durable, optimal or even just satisfying results. But probably architecture and design constitute means of negotiation, rather than solutions in themselves. They could be understood as cultural methods to spatially negotiate power structures and social relations.Jesko Fezer (*1970) is a Berlin-based architect. In the 2004-founded architecture cooperation 'ifau und Jesko Fezer' he realised projects in Munich, Stuttgart, Berlin, Utrecht, Graz, New York and London. He is co-manager of the thematic bookshop Pro qm”and co-editor of the political architecture magazine An Architektur.

It is a particles accelerator used by physicists to study the smallest known particles – the fundamental building blocks of all  things. It will revolutionise our understanding, from the minuscule world deep within atoms ... to the vastness of the Universe.Two beams of subatomic particles called 'hadrons' – either protons or lead ions – will travel in opposite directions inside the circular accelerator at the speed of light, gaining energy with every lap. Physicists will use the LHC to recreate the conditions just after the Big Bang, by colliding the two beams head-on at very high energy. Teams of physicists from around the world will analyse the particles created in the collisions using special detectors in a number of experiments dedicated to the LHC.Our understanding of the Universe is about to change …Angelo Merlino was born in Messina, Sicily, in 1937 and grew up in Turin. It was while working in a mechanical workshop that he was introduced to the world of mechanics. He later found a job designing explosion proof equipment for chemical and petroleum plants, eventually also organising the explosion tests at the Politecnico di Torino.He arrived in CERN In 1964 when they had only just started the first Proto Synchrotron (PS) machine. His first job was to work with the Linear Accelerator (LINAC) group for a new project called 'Duoplasmatron', which produces ions (protons) from hydrogen before being accelerated. His main duties have been designing beam monitors, beam transfer equipment, electrical and hydraulic handling machines for installation of magnets, structure for experimental areas, etc. He also worked for the Super Proto Synchrotron (SPS), especially for the protons-antiprotons experiment, and later for the Large Electro Positon collider (LEP), in the original underground tunnel (27.6 km circumference) that later became the Large Hadrons Collider (LHC).Angelo ended his career as project leader for two constructions called 'Rotating Shielding'.  A 420-ton structure made of thick steel and concrete, designed to provide radiation protection at both ends of the experiment called CMS (Compact Muon Solenoid) of the LHC. This work was carried out in collaboration with the Russian Institute of Theoretical Physics in Protvino (Moscow).",

Ironically, however, its growing popularity is inversely proportional to the increasing sense of political powerlessness and cultural disillusionment many architects feel about their effective contribution to the built world. Within this paradoxical situation – and beyond the phenomenon of architecture’s 'success' – it is necessary to face and acknowledge the popularity of architecture critically. To do so, we need to seriously address the unequivocal social and cultural power architecture possesses to produce representations of the world through exemplary forms of built reality. At this level, the problem of form – that is, the strategising of architecture’s being – becomes crucial. The making of form is thus the real and effective necessary program of architecture. But what form can architecture define within the contemporary city without falling into the current self-absorbed performances of iconic buildings, parametric designs, or redundant mappings of every possible complexity and contradiction of the urban world? What sort of significant and critical relationship can architecture aspire to in a world that is no longer constituted by the idea and the motivations of the city, but is instead dominated by urbanisation?' from The Possibility of an Absolute ArchitectureIn The Possibility of an Absolute Architecture, Pier Vittorio Aureli proposes that a sharpened formal consciousness in architecture is a precondition for political, cultural, and social engagement with the city. Aureli uses the term absolute not in the conventional sense of 'pure', but to denote something that is resolutely itself after being separated from its other. In the pursuit of the possibility of an absolute architecture, the other is the space of the city, its extensive organisation, and its government. Politics is agonism through separation and confrontation; the very condition of architectural form is to separate and be separated. Through its act of separation and being separated, architecture reveals at once the essence of the city and the essence of itself as political form: the city as the composition of (separate) parts. Aureli revisits the work of four architects whose projects were advanced through the making of architectural form but whose concern was the city at large: Andrea Palladio, Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Etienne-Louis Boullée, and Oswald Mathias Ungers. The work of these architects, Aureli argues, addressed the transformations of the modern city and its urban implications through the elaboration of specific and strategic architectural forms. Their projects for the city do not take the form of an overall plan but are expressed as an 'archipelago' of site-specific interventions.'What at first glance appears to be a book of architectural history is in fact a radical attack on theory, sweeping away the foundations of current thought in its wake. Aureli's work stands against the forces of an unlimited urbanisation, proposing an idea of absolute architecture as a confrontation with the forces of global capital. A must-read for those passionate about architecture and its future.'Peter Eisenman 'Challenging the discursive boundaries and interpretative habits of countless late modern and contemporary architectural histories and theories, and with penetrating analysis directed at a compelling band of co-conspirators, from Palladio to Ungers, this book is a forensic tour de force.

        "detail": "Organised by Simos YannasIraqi courtyard houses are an indigenous type dating back to the antiquities of Mesopotamia in the milieu of Sumerian, Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian civilisations. They underwent gradual developments during these periods as well as during the various Islamic dynasties. By about 1850, they had reached a level of general approval, if not that of near perfection within the limitations of building technology at the time. Sadly, since 1914, they have undergone systematic demolition; first by the Ottomans, then by the British occupying forces, and finally by successive Iraqi governments after independence, largely undocumented. All this was done in the name of modernity to provide roads and contemporary buildings.During 1971–72, Al-Azzawi carried out systematic and scientific measurements, analyses and appraisals of their micro-climatic and thermal environmental characteristics. He also carried out surveys for measured drawings and documented them photographically to show their many advantageous qualities. He did the same for modern non-courtyard houses for comparative studies.In this lecture, he aims to show the results of his fieldwork and effectson his architectural work both in the UK and abroad.Subhi Al-Azzawi was born in Baghdad to a family of 12 master-builders over five generations (including his father and two grandparents). He was trained at the AA (1962–68), and in 1969 started his PhD research thesis at the Bartlett, UCL (while  working as an architect), receiving his Doctorate in 1984. In 1987–88, he was a Visiting Fellow of the Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture at Harvard University and MIT, giving a short course on 'Design with Climate and Culture'. In 1990–91, he extended it to 36-hour lecture course for MSc and PhD students at Reading University, where he also acted as an external examiner. He has given and published many position papers at international conferences and symposia on four continents, as well as giving lectures at their universities. He co-authored, edited and illustrated Climate and House Design (UN 1971). He has concurrently practised architecture, climatic and environmental design, as well as urban design for 40 years. He also acted as consultant to British and American architects and planners.",

        "detail": "Rococo Relevance is a research project that explores the potential of history as a reference for contemporary design. Merx and Holl are not searching for general historical rules but for the exceptions that question the existence of those rules, for that part of history that has been ignored until now. They use aversion as an indicator of habits and taboos that restrict our exploration of the possible.  Since they don't believe in a 'truth out there' that can be found and discovered, they search for radical subjectivity and the potential of multiple meanings within the architectural discourse. In their research they reflect on today’s architectural practice, its restriction through myths or dogmas, and on personal relation to the world that surrounds us. Luc Merx is interested in the borders between architecture, design and art. He founded his practice, Gagat International, in Rotterdam in 1999. In 2003, a grant from the Netherlands Foundation BKVB provided him with the opportunity to study the parallels between late baroque architecture in Southern Germany and the influence of computers on modern architecture.He has taught at several schools, including the Universities of Technology in Eindhoven and Darmstadt and is currently a professor at the University of Technology in Kaiserslautern as well as head of the Maastricht Building Academy.Christian Holl studied art in Stuttgart and Münster and architecture in Aachen, Florence and Stuttgart. He was editor of db deutsche Bauzeitung 1997–2004. In 2004 he founded frei04 publizistik together with Ursula Baus and Klaus Siegele. He has published several books, and works as a freelance editor and critic. He was assistant professor at the Institute of Urbanism at University of Stuttgart 2005–10 in teaching and research. He is curator at the Weissenhof gallery for architecture in Stuttgart. Since 2010 he has been managing director of the association of German Architects BDA in Hessen",

Volume 1 was launched at the AA on 7 December 2010; Volume 2 will come out in autumn 2011. The purpose of the book is to give leadership to the discipline. It presents a systematic treatise on architecture, a unified theory constructed on the basis of a comprehensive discourse analysis of the discipline, rationally reconstructed as autopoietic system of communications, within the framework of Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory. \nThe theory of architectural autopoiesis constructs a unified theoretical system that integrates many partial theories. The following theories are presented in Volume 1: theories of architectural theory; of architecture’s historical emergence; of the discipline’s self- demarcation; of the avant-garde; of the form-function aesthetic theory; of style(s), design media theory; and of architecture’s societal function. (Volume 2 continues with theories of architecture’s task articulated into an organisational, a phenomenological, and a semiological dimension; design process theory; of architecture’s relevant societal environment; of architecture’s relationship to politics; of architectural self-description. Volume two ends with a comprehensive argument for parametricism as unified, epochal style for the 21st century.)\nGuests/speakers might pick one of following topics/questions (or bring anything else into the debate):A fundamental question of ethos/ideology/discursive culture: Should we – the participants/protagonists of architecture –  commit/submit ourselves to a collective debate arguing about the direction in which architecture should progress?Is all relevant architecture globally relevant architecture, i.e. world architecture?In which way is architecture autonomous? Is architecture one of the great autopoietic function systems of society?Demarcating architecture: Does architecture/design constitute a sui generis discursive field and domain of expertise distinct from art, engineering and science?The raison d’etre of architecture: Does architecture have a specific role or function to fulfil within society?Does architecture have a stable discursive core identity? Which are the permanent and which the variable communication structures of architecture?Can architecture be defined via its lead distinction of form vs function?Is the distinction between avant-garde and mainstream a useful schema to analyse what goes on in architecture?What is the role of architectural theory? Can there be architecture without theory?Is the category of beauty still valid within architecture? What is the role and raison d’etre of aesthetic values?What is the significance and import of the evolving design media?Is the category of style(s) still valid (or even necessary) within architecture?Does it make sense to propose a comprehensive, unified theory of architecture in the form of an elaborate theoretical system?These are topics that might be raised by any of the speakers, or these might be questions with which the speakers might be confronted by the host.

Volume 1 was launched at the AA on 7 December 2010; Volume 2 will come out in autumn 2011. The purpose of the book is to give leadership to the discipline. It presents a systematic treatise on architecture, a unified theory constructed on the basis of a comprehensive discourse analysis of the discipline, rationally reconstructed as autopoietic system of communications, within the framework of Niklas Luhmann’s social systems theory. \nThe theory of architectural autopoiesis constructs a unified theoretical system that integrates many partial theories. The following theories are presented in Volume 1: theories of architectural theory; of architecture’s historical emergence; of the discipline’s self- demarcation; of the avant-garde; of the form-function aesthetic theory; of style(s), design media theory; and of architecture’s societal function. (Volume 2 continues with theories of architecture’s task articulated into an organisational, a phenomenological, and a semiological dimension; design process theory; of architecture’s relevant societal environment; of architecture’s relationship to politics; of architectural self-description. Volume two ends with a comprehensive argument for parametricism as unified, epochal style for the 21st century.)Guests/speakers might pick one of following topics/questions (or bring anything else into the debate):A fundamental question of ethos/ideology/discursive culture: Should we – the participants/protagonists of architecture –  commit/submit ourselves to a collective debate arguing about the direction in which architecture should progress?Is all relevant architecture globally relevant architecture, i.e. world architecture?In which way is architecture autonomous? Is architecture one of the great autopoietic function systems of society?Demarcating architecture: Does architecture/design constitute a sui generis discursive field and domain of expertise distinct from art, engineering and science?The raison d’etre of architecture: Does architecture have a specific role or function to fulfil within society?Does architecture have a stable discursive core identity? Which are the permanent and which the variable communication structures of architecture?Can architecture be defined via its lead distinction of form vs function?Is the distinction between avant-garde and mainstream a useful schema to analyse what goes on in architecture?What is the role of architectural theory? Can there be architecture without theory?Is the category of beauty still valid within architecture? What is the role and raison d’etre of aesthetic values?What is the significance and import of the evolving design media?Is the category of style(s) still valid (or even necessary) within architecture?Does it make sense to propose a comprehensive, unified theory of architecture in the form of an elaborate theoretical system?These are topics that might be raised by any of the speakers, or these might be questions with which the speakers might be confronted by the host.

The companies have SOFT values such as broadcasting rights (Mediapro), patents (Indra), intelligence (T-systems), programming (Cisco) and interaction (such as Reactable by Sergi Jorda, from Universitat PompeuFabra), it is a district – in the words of Artur Serra from I2CAT and the 22@ team– that represents a Living Lab.\nAnd finally, in the words of the magazine Wired and Leonardo from MITPress, 22@ is SOFT, and today SOFT is HARD. \nMedia-ICT’s architecture is an environment where SOFT becomes HARD. \n02___________22@ is a city model where residential zones and clean new industry coexist: this program really appealed to us as its use is three-fold.\nThe ground floor is open-plan and has a multi-media museum, Internet awareness workshops, as well as the UOC institutes that are the fruit of this fabric; it is a place where the convention hall is a shared space.\nThese new companies, such as Barcelona Activa, will occupy these small offices.\nThe upper floors will be an incubator for young companies; they will also provide a landing space for foreign companies.\nMedia-ICT incubates and fosters exchange.\nWe felt that this should not be a public or private building or a corporate or company-oriented building, it should not be academic or businesslike, but it should be a hybrid program\nExperts call this type of model GGG - Global Green Growth.\nThis is a large building based on the idea of sharing, where all the green spaces are shared. Before, one way or another, you had to have those spaces available, now you can share them, the building has some 15% dedicated to shared spaces.\n(see Floor Plans)\nThis is a distinct possibility in this city, where the urban experimentation of compact density as conveyed by Oriol Clos, the head architect.\n03__________Media-ICT is a Parametric Design application\nAs architects of parametric architecture, what should we do?.\nWe think in terms of modules: the structure is a 5 m x 14.7 m module; false roofs are 30 cm modules; raised floors are 50 cm modules; everything is connected and related: the 150 cm glass façade module is joined to the floor, to the module, with the 150 cm fluorescent module, the 300 cm radius façade sensors and so on and so forth.\nWe have studied the program for the building and its possible floor plans using Autocad software linked to Excel and a script programmed in Cloud 9.\nIn this way we optimise:> 36 m evacuation distances in case of fire.> the maximum area of the program with natural lighting, X.> the flexibility of floor distribution, 7,26.> the ratio of m2 distributed with regard to constructed m2.\nFor example, we study the minimum impact of the vertical communication cores in terms of the m2 of the distributed program (such cores are generally between 18-20% of the total surface area).\nThis is a building with a low ratio; we stand at 8%, which means that there is 10% available and you have more meters to be used by the people (almost 2.000 m2), which is just like gaining a floor.\nYou enter the data and Excel constructs the building.\nAt the end, it is Excel that creates this extremely dense information byte that includes everything.\nThe result is a very COMPACT, very dense and very efficient element. Media-ICT is NOT a CUBE but an information BYTE: 40x40x40m.\nReferences: Ford Foundation in New York, by Kevin Roche\n(see diagrams)\n04_________________STRUCTURE\nWe presented the project to the Quality Committee of Barcelona City Council and one of their questions was: “Architecture is often connected to certain physical, vegetable and animal states. If this is the case, what animal does this architectural structure represent? It was an interesting question...\nNaturally, the jellyfish came to mind, as it is an organism, a system, but within it there are several bodies, there are several individuals.\nIt is a program that creates a system and a structural typology.\nWe have been in the Maravillas Gymnasium by Alejandro de la Sota.\nThis is our background, it is our starting point.\nIn the 22@ district there have always been these metallic structures, and when they are constructed on the streets, they have been expressed outwards.\nWe wanted to convey these structures as knowledge platforms expressed outwards, creating a sense of dialogue with the city.\nOther examples are the Chocolate Factory and the AEG Turbine Factory by Peter Behrens, who began with architecture and structure, but ended up creating the SYSTEM.\nWith Agustí Obiol of Boma we discussed\n“What is a structure like in a DIGITAL environment?”\n“It is not about gravity, or mass, or tectonics, it is about connectivity, links - it is TENSILE, with ties”.\nOur construction is built from the top and moves downwards, becoming transparent, anti-gravitational, and almost liquid at the bottom.\nThus, its impact on the street is minimal, about 8% mass with respect to the 1500 m2 floor surface area.\nWe decided to invest 40% of the construction budget in the structure of the building (instead of the normal 25% or 30%)\nAn inhabitable truss, which is similar to living surrounded by the NETWORK, a network, a structure that supports the building but comprises TRANSLUCENT spaces, flexible spaces, open spaces.\nIf we take into account that the structure is a suspended structure and the pillars are not 50x50 pillars, but 12x12 or 15x15...\nThis voltage cable network is distributed with large 14x5m dimensions.\nThe ground floor does not have pillars; public space invades the building with 36m x 40m of free space.\n(see Pictures)\n \nA public architectural structure dedicated to public space in line with a Situationist perception.\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE Media-ICT ACTS AS A NETWORK.\nA distributed not centralized structure.\nDistributed computing, distributed networks...\nCentralized networks cause breakdowns, distributed networks do NOT.\nThere are 18 different sections of tubes to optimize the kilos of steel.\nThere are 120 types of “FLOWERS” to solve the complexity issue.\nTherefore, it is not a calculation of a “peak” stress point nor is it based on a standard solution; there is no unique steel solution for the entire structure, but hundreds of distributed calculations for all points, and bars.\nIn other words, everything is nonstandard (such as the Pompidou Centre exposition, curetted by Frédéric Migayrou).\n(see Diagrams)\nIs this a shock?\nThe industry is ready for this digital revolution.\nCloud 9, together with Boma, have designed this structure to be built using CADCAM digital processes.\nWe work in 3D with Rhyno, 3D Max and MicroStation, and they work in 3D with CAD.\nThe economics must be sustainable. We can only build complex Gaudí-like structures with very fast software and manufacturing components.\nWe constructed the building from the bottom up, while they elevated it and then put it in place.\nIt seems that we are winning the battle against gravity.\nThe system was the deserved winner of the 2009 EUROPEAN AWARD FOR STEEL STRUCTURES, of the ECCS (European Convention for Construction Steel work).\nThis process is called CAD-CAM, we are CAD-CAM process architects.\nA light element that unifies the whole structure...\nJeremy Rifkin argues in his third industrial revolution that if construction is the main cause of climate change, let’s also make construction the solution to the problem: instead of a problem, it becomes the solution.\nWith this objective, we can convert buildings into power plants, into energy factories, that are OFF GRID, that are not in the network and that are fully self-sufficient. \nHere, in the Media-ICT, at a conceptual level, we take a look at certain elements, such as bioluminescent painting.\nWhat we do is to treat the entire tensile digital structure with this bioluminescent paint.\nThis makes the framework visible, but it does not consume, it is self-sufficient.\nThis year’s edition of the Nobel Prize in Physics is also dedicated to bioluminescence.\nThe collaborative work of Cloud 9 with Euroquimica has led to this innovation, this patent that is compatible with achieving class RF-120 resistance.\n05__________________My wish for the CONSTRUCTION is to think, believe that the Media-ICT is on a par with the balance and complexity that we have learnt from Gaudí’s\nLa Pedrera.\nBut we will leave this to the experts such as Daniel Giralt Miracle so that they can make judgments and criticize.\nOur work process to create these skins has been program-structure-skin.\nAnd this skin is an expression of energy.\nIf we think about Gaudí’s La Pedrera, it is a construction system that projects a landscape towards the city.\nIt is the building that must have a dialogue with the city.\nWe need solutions. How do we find these solutions?\nLet’s take a scientific look at urban landscape, let’s make it a performance, let’s make it performative, with energy as its script. This is the project.\nThis is Media-ICT: meeting energy criteria through beautiful, performative, communicative, urban landscape, which is educational, opening people’s eyes, so that they are aware of key problems such as energy. \n06__________________ENERGY EFFICIENCY of the Media-ICT:\nETFE SKIN\nThe mayor, in his speech the other day, talked to us about green cities.\nIf we consider Jeremy Rifkin’s theory, buildings represent 35-40% of the climate change problem.\nAs architects, we are the main cause of climate change... So we need to take it seriously...\nIn the European Union there is talk of a 20% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2020. Some 20% of our building’s energy will be clean energy with regard to what we consume.\nMedia-ICT targets an achieves:\n1-20% CO2 reduction due to the use of District Cooling, clean energy.\n2-10% CO2 reduction due to the photovoltaic roof.\n3-55% CO2 reduction due to the dynamic ETFE sun filters.\n4-10% CO2 reduction due to energy efficiency related to smart sensors. \nTotal 95% CO2 reduction, the Media-ICT is a NET building almost a net zero building.\nAs an example, if the building code demands a factor of 0.45, thanks to the new systems and patents in this building, we can achieve a target of 0.10.\nAnother example is the photovoltaic roof that produces about 29,000 kWh/year which represents some 18.8 tones of savings in atmospheric CO2 emissions.\nThe Media-ICT is this new wave of green architecture, with energy as its principal argument.\nWhat is the ETFE? It is Teflon, a crystallized polymer, a Teflon-based polymer. ETFE is very light; there are no frames; it is highly resistant (1,500 kg); it is perfect for fire escapes; and is an interesting material for public spaces.\nDragados has managed to accurately assemble ETFE and the structure, thanks to the use of 3D topography through 3 mm resolution scanners for a 40m façade.\nWe now turn to the technical data:\nStudy of shade and ratio of urbanity.\nCalculation of solar energy according to the orientation of the façades:\nOn the north façades there are 2.000 watts per hour.\nOn the south façades there are 6.500 watts per hour.\nThis is a difference of 300%.\nThe ETFE skin enables us to build these design values:\nSA Solar factor open 0.35\nSA Solar factor closed 0.10\nCAC Solar factor without fog 0.45\nCAC Solar factor with fog 0.10\nTake a look at the CAC façade SF with fog value of 0.10, in other words 4 times more effective than the TBC.\nWho governs this?\nThe building creates and coordinates a vertical cloud to filter the sun; the building creates it and repeats it over and over again.\nThus, the DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE, there are more than 500 sensors in the Media-ICT.\nThe ground floor proximity sensor regulates consumption according to how people move along the lobby.\nThe façade sensors connected to the Iguzzini lighting save energy by preventing consumption in the first three meters of the façade (TBC).\nFinally the 104 sensors, within the black box and the Arduino soft, connected to the ETFE cushions makes each cushion, each construction element of the façade intelligent.\nThe director of the Cité d’Architecture in Paris Francis Rambert said we are standing before the Barcelona’s Pompidou Centre.\nDistributed smart tech:\nEach inflatable having an IP address, using Arduino soft – this enables the building not only to close or open all the curtains, which not only activates the patches of clouds and decides which neighbour produces what shade, but the building also modulates and responds like a reactive skin, with 104 IP addresses attached to such reaction.\nIf the entire building is based on the idea of distribution, the computing should be distributed. If you create a model in which there is a hierarchy with a central computer, if this computer crashes, the entire building crashes.\nI must add that we aim for the best energy performance results.\nIt is still too early to disclose complex public results but we can talk about the Honorable mention from the Premi Medi Ambient de la Generalitat de Catalunya in 2009 (R&D and Innovation Projects), aimed at sustainable construction, and research in ETFE used in the Media-ICT architecture.\n07 __________________INNOVATION\nThis is our formula: Energy efficiency as a catalyst of innovation.\nThere are 4 major buildings in the world with ETFE:\nEden in London: the transparent ETFE cladding creates a microclimate.\nArena in Munich: the EFTE covering complete with lighting creates an icon.\nBeijing Water Cube: the EFTE cladding with its double illumination creates an icon.\nAnd now the Media-ICT: ETFE with three layers, with intelligence, without lighting, not as an iconic style of architecture, but certainly energy performative architecture.\nAnd I would like to emphasize it is not about icon architecture or star architect but energy efficient performative architecture.\nThis is the first ETFE building in Spain. \nIn the industrial age, solar solutions were physical, mechanical, hydraulic...\nTake the Arab World Institute by Jean Nouvel in Paris as an example.\nBut the digital world moves with particles, with simple elements, with steam, air with atmospheric and gaseous worlds.\nAs Terry Riley says of our architecture in the catalogue of the MOMA exhibition: '… we carry out Performative Architecture” \nMilestone: a cloud of nitrogen.\nA vertical cloud filtering solar radiation.\nThe building creates a vertical cloud of fog, increasing the density of the air of the ETFE cushions with nitrogen particles; the SF (solar factor) of the building goes from 0.45 to 0.10.\nCan we prevent a sunbeam, ray of light, heat from entering the office, while creating certain particles so that the sunbeam is broken down and the solar factor is lowered? Yes we can.\n80% of the fog is composed of nitrogen particles.\nResults:\nThese two patents are created:\nETFE Diaphragm, ETFE Fog.\nOur buildings should be performative. Architecture is no longer on/off, a/b, it is a dynamic architecture.\nWe have to make architecture as similar as possible to these natural plant processes pursuing and performing, what activates its photosynthesis, its physics, its chemistry, its inner material. \n08____________________ ECONOMY\nAccording to Jeremy Rifkin, we are heading towards a New Humanism, with architecture that empathizes with the Environment and towards a new economy.\nThere is talk about the GREEN SHOOTS of the economy ... this building is one.\nIt is in total ALIGNMENT with the objectives that the Consorci have talked about: technical and economic rigor, competitiveness, sustainability…\nThis building has cost 24,5 million Euros and has a ratio of 1,234 Euros per m2 above ground level.\nIn this way money will not be excuse not to fulfill the GREEN NEW DEAL.\n ",

Some 20% of our building’s energy will be clean energy with regard to what we consume.\nMedia-ICT targets an achieves:\n1-20% CO2 reduction due to the use of District Cooling, clean energy.\n2-10% CO2 reduction due to the photovoltaic roof.\n3-55% CO2 reduction due to the dynamic ETFE sun filters.\n4-10% CO2 reduction due to energy efficiency related to smart sensors. \nTotal 95% CO2 reduction, the Media-ICT is a NET building almost a net zero building.\nAs an example, if the building code demands a factor of 0.45, thanks to the new systems and patents in this building, we can achieve a target of 0.10.\nAnother example is the photovoltaic roof that produces about 29,000 kWh/year which represents some 18.8 tones of savings in atmospheric CO2 emissions.\nThe Media-ICT is this new wave of green architecture, with energy as its principal argument.\nWhat is the ETFE? It is Teflon, a crystallized polymer, a Teflon-based polymer. ETFE is very light; there are no frames; it is highly resistant (1,500 kg); it is perfect for fire escapes; and is an interesting material for public spaces.\nDragados has managed to accurately assemble ETFE and the structure, thanks to the use of 3D topography through 3 mm resolution scanners for a 40m façade.\nWe now turn to the technical data:\nStudy of shade and ratio of urbanity.\nCalculation of solar energy according to the orientation of the façades:\nOn the north façades there are 2.000 watts per hour.\nOn the south façades there are 6.500 watts per hour.\nThis is a difference of 300%.\nThe ETFE skin enables us to build these design values:\nSA Solar factor open 0.35\nSA Solar factor closed 0.10\nCAC Solar factor without fog 0.45\nCAC Solar factor with fog 0.10\nTake a look at the CAC façade SF with fog value of 0.10, in other words 4 times more effective than the TBC.\nWho governs this?\nThe building creates and coordinates a vertical cloud to filter the sun; the building creates it and repeats it over and over again.\nThus, the DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENCE, there are more than 500 sensors in the Media-ICT.\nThe ground floor proximity sensor regulates consumption according to how people move along the lobby.\nThe façade sensors connected to the Iguzzini lighting save energy by preventing consumption in the first three meters of the façade (TBC).\nFinally the 104 sensors, within the black box and the Arduino soft, connected to the ETFE cushions makes each cushion, each construction element of the façade intelligent.\nThe director of the Cité d’Architecture in Paris Francis Rambert said we are standing before the Barcelona’s Pompidou Centre.\nDistributed smart tech:\nEach inflatable having an IP address, using Arduino soft – this enables the building not only to close or open all the curtains, which not only activates the patches of clouds and decides which neighbour produces what shade, but the building also modulates and responds like a reactive skin, with 104 IP addresses attached to such reaction.\nIf the entire building is based on the idea of distribution, the computing should be distributed. If you create a model in which there is a hierarchy with a central computer, if this computer crashes, the entire building crashes.\nI must add that we aim for the best energy performance results.\nIt is still too early to disclose complex public results but we can talk about the Honorable mention from the Premi Medi Ambient de la Generalitat de Catalunya in 2009 (R&D and Innovation Projects), aimed at sustainable construction, and research in ETFE used in the Media-ICT architecture.\n07 __________________INNOVATION\nThis is our formula: Energy efficiency as a catalyst of innovation.\nThere are 4 major buildings in the world with ETFE:\nEden in London: the transparent ETFE cladding creates a microclimate.\nArena in Munich: the EFTE covering complete with lighting creates an icon.\nBeijing Water Cube: the EFTE cladding with its double illumination creates an icon.\nAnd now the Media-ICT: ETFE with three layers, with intelligence, without lighting, not as an iconic style of architecture, but certainly energy performative architecture.\nAnd I would like to emphasize it is not about icon architecture or star architect but energy efficient performative architecture.\nThis is the first ETFE building in Spain. \nIn the industrial age, solar solutions were physical, mechanical, hydraulic...\nTake the Arab World Institute by Jean Nouvel in Paris as an example.\nBut the digital world moves with particles, with simple elements, with steam, air with atmospheric and gaseous worlds.\nAs Terry Riley says of our architecture in the catalogue of the MOMA exhibition: '… we carry out Performative Architecture” \nMilestone: a cloud of nitrogen.\nA vertical cloud filtering solar radiation.\nThe building creates a vertical cloud of fog, increasing the density of the air of the ETFE cushions with nitrogen particles; the SF (solar factor) of the building goes from 0.45 to 0.10.\nCan we prevent a sunbeam, ray of light, heat from entering the office, while creating certain particles so that the sunbeam is broken down and the solar factor is lowered? Yes we can.\n80% of the fog is composed of nitrogen particles.\nResults:\nThese two patents are created:\nETFE Diaphragm, ETFE Fog.\nOur buildings should be performative. Architecture is no longer on/off, a/b, it is a dynamic architecture.\nWe have to make architecture as similar as possible to these natural plant processes pursuing and performing, what activates its photosynthesis, its physics, its chemistry, its inner material. \n08____________________ ECONOMY\nAccording to Jeremy Rifkin, we are heading towards a New Humanism, with architecture that empathizes with the Environment and towards a new economy.\nThere is talk about the GREEN SHOOTS of the economy ... this building is one.\nIt is in total ALIGNMENT with the objectives that the Consorci have talked about: technical and economic rigor, competitiveness, sustainability…\nThis building has cost 24,5 million Euros and has a ratio of 1,234 Euros per m2 above ground level.\nIn this way money will not be excuse not to fulfill the GREEN NEW DEAL.\n ",

We want to build internationa'ly. We want to collaborate with other offices.' Eight years and about 20 built projects later they will try to tell why they think that this overambitious mission statement was helping them to build more then others do at the beginning of their career, why they think that it is important to build a lot and why mission statements are not so important after all. HHF architects was founded in 2003 by Tilo Herlach, Simon Hartmann and Simon Frommenwiler. Since then HHF architects has realised projects in Switzerland, Germany, China, Mexico and the USA. The scope of work ranges broadly and includes large-scale construction, e.g., fashion centre Labels Berlin 2; interior design, e.g., the Confiserie Bachmann in Basel; masterplanning, e.g., the public space and mobility strategy for the Praille Acacias Vernets, Geneva; public structures, e.g., Ruta del Peregrino Lookout Point of a pilgrimage route in Mexico; or the Baby Dragon pavilion in the Jinhua Architecture Park, China. From the beginning HHF has sought collaborations with other architects, artists and specialists in order to widen the view on a project and enrich the quality of a specific proposal. In addition to building, teaching is an important activity of the office.",

In 2002 he bought a 50p plastic camera from a market at Hackney Wick and started to photograph the surrounding neighbourhood. A continued fascination with his local area can be seen in the later series Hackney Flowers, where Gill collected flowers and objects from the area, layering them on to his photographs. A selection of these prints were then buried in Hackney Wick itself and later dug up when, marked and distorted by decay from the process, Gill photographed again to form the final piece.Stephen Gill’s work is held in public and private collections worldwide and he has been exhibited internationally. He has self-published a number of books through his imprint Nobody Books, including Hackney Wick (2005), Hackney Flowers (2007), A Book of Birds (2010) and B Sides (2010).This is the second part of the key speakers series run in conjunction with the The Photographers' Gallery featuring key photographers, writers and theorists. This series looks at photography rationalisation and depiction of architectural space and its role as a tool in deciphering the urban environment.Book tickets ",

His first book, On Living in an Old Country (1985), was a critical examination of the rise of ‘heritage’ as a theme in British public life, and he has since written A Journey Through Ruins: the Last Days of London (1991), The Village that Died for England (1995), Tank: the Progress of a Monstrous War Machine (2001), Iron Curtain: From Stage to Cold War (2007) and, most recently, Passport to Peking (2010), which traces the attempt, made by various British architects, artists, writers and scientists, to open an independent British relationship with the People’s Republic of China in 1954.",

Just as 20 years earlier in Broadwater Farm, even Le Corbusier himself was blamed for the street fights that took place. Does architectural form have the power to change people’s behaviour in such violent ways as some critics would have you believe? Are these riots insurrections against oppression, or are they part of a culture of violence, that uses modern urban spaces as its theatrical backdrop? Who is to blame? The system, the rioter, the architect?Wouter Vanstiphout is part of Crimson Architectural Historians.

Recognizing the built environment as protagonist to, or at least accomplice of, financial catastrophe underlines the urgency of designing for the possibilities and pitfalls of American democratic capitalism. By way of a post-apocalyptic settlement in Montréal, a public learning centre about finance and architecture in New York City, and a plan for the riverfront of Newark, New Jersey, this lecture will explore how tools of design might help reform relationships between people and their living environments.Damon Rich currently serves as the Urban Designer for the City of Newark, New Jersey.

Proponents of tall buildings, while embracing the concepts and principles of environmental design show little evidence of successful performance.In this context, the main contribution of this book is a critical review of the environmental tall building, encompassing a comprehensive qualitative definition of the sustainable tall building, followed by facts and figures of case studies, including real-life data. In addition, the book brings a global perspective of ideas, design approaches and targets for the environmental tall building in cities which became referential centres of verticalisation in the last two decades.Joana Carla Soares Gonçalves is an architect and urbanist from the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, the city where she practised with Ana Maria Niemeyer before taking the MA in Environment & Energy Studies at the AA and a PhD on the sustainability of tall buildings at the University of São Paulo, where she has taught since 1998. She has worked as an environmental consultant on projects around Brazil and won awards in a number of design competitions. Currently she is part of SED programme staff at the AA. Her book The Environmental Performance of Tall Buildings was published by Earthscan in June 2010.Book Sales (pre/post lecture) and Drinks Reception (post lecture) to celebrate the launch of this publication.  ",

At first glance, what appears prescient about the 1960s when looking at current US culture is the preoccupation with computer technology, the natural environment and alternative forms of community; but today each is disconnected from the radical political action and oppositional ideologies of the earlier era. Discuss.This afternoon's roundtable conversation will include Jeffrey Inaba, Mark Wigley and others, and will be moderated by Brett Steele.Jeffrey Inaba is director of the Columbia Laboratory for Architectural Broadcasting (C-Lab), in Columbia University’s Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. This research unit studies urban and architecture issues of public consequence. C-Lab experiments with forms of architectural communication that it presents through various outlets including Volume magazine and online, print, and exhibition venues. Inaba is features editor at Volume and the author of World of Giving (Lars Muller, 2010).",

In this lecture he reflects on the thinking which has consistently lain behind projects as diverse as a small flat for the writer Bruce Chatwin created at the beginning of his career and a new Cistercian monastery in Bohemia, where work has been ongoing for a decade. John Pawson was born in 1949 in Halifax, Yorkshire. Following a period in the family textile business, he spent a number of years living and working in Japan. Following his return to England, he enrolled at the AA, leaving to establish his own practice in 1981.From the outset Pawson’s work has focused on ways of approaching fundamental problems of space, proportion, light and materials. Projects have spanned a wide range of scales and typologies, including a new Cistercian monastery in Bohemia and a lake crossing at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew.A major exhibition, John Pawson Plain Space, runs at the Design Museum, London, until 30 January 2011. ",

He has been involved in publishing almost from the day that he picked up his first camera. In 2007, he launched Motto, a distribution company for magazines, books and other types of independent publications, eventually expanding to a bookshop in Berlin in early 2009. Three new branches opened in Zurich, Geneva and Vancouver in 2010, all within exhibition spaces. Motto distributes 100 publishers to some 100 specialised stores worldwide and, with Chert Gallery, has recently organised two editions of the Unter Dem Motto book fair.",

Public space offers a stage, architecture the settings. The performance, city life, is often predictable, but at times unexpected, suprising or shocking. In the last decades we can observe a strong tendency to make public life more predictable. The brief for architecture and urbanism is no longer to stage urban life, but to design the performance of city life itself. On stage 'the public' wants to see themselves, acting as a public, like in a mirror.Arnold Reijndorp is an independent researcher at the cutting edge of urbanism/architecture and social and cultural developments in the urban field.

From research projects, such as the Sealand Identity Project (2004), Museum of Conflict (2006), and Quaero (2007), the group has moved into installation making and speculative design projects, such as Affiche Frontière (CAPC musée d’art contemporain de Bordeaux, 2008) and Stadtstaat (Künstlerhaus Stuttgart and Casco Utrecht, 2009).  Metahaven also produces commissioned work for clients, such as the Antennae paperback series for publishing house Valiz. Metahaven’s work has been included in group exhibitions like Forms of Inquiry (Architectural Association, London, 2007, cat.) and On Purpose – Design Concepts  (Arnolfini, Bristol, 2008), and is included in Manifesta8 – The European Biennial for Contemporary Art (Murcia, Spain, 2010).

        "detail": "Organised by Pier Vittorio Aureli and Barbara Campbell (Diploma 14)Today, notwithstanding the fact that we are witness to impressive, global processes of urbanisation and concentration, a reflection on the future of the world-metropolis is still being played out in the European city, considered representative of a more emblematic condition, if not an implicit model, of the city's growth and its relative problems.In fact, the characteristic of discontinuity that marks the urban form of the European city can be recognised in the tension between two opposing ideas of the city. On the one hand, the concept of urbanisation as infrastructure, a system of territorial organisation and control based on the performance of a certain number of activities; on the other hand, the idea of the city as a centre, a system for the representation of political, social and religious values that justify and orient these activities. This tension between centre and infrastructure has always constituted the richest and most original patrimony of the European city, whose peculiarity can, in the end, be traced back to Rome. What Rome has offered over the centuries, to Europe and the western world, feeding the most radical architectural visions for urban projects in the modern and even the postmodern era, is the exemplary nature of the city. If the typical Roman city is produced, so to speak, by the precepts of urban planning, Rome is, instead, the locus within which this role falls directly upon architecture that, materialising the successive symbolic aspects of the city, continually questions and redefines, using its own instruments, the very nature of its urban structure.",

Lee reflects upon the possibility of a renewed understanding of typology as an operative theory for the practice of architecture in a globalized world.Christopher C M Lee is the co-founder and principal of Serie. He graduated with the AA Diploma (Hons) and is the co-director of the AA Projective Cities Programme. He previously taught at the AA in Histories and Theories Studies (2009–10) and was the Unit Master for Diploma School (Unit 6, 2004–09) and Intermediate School (Unit 2, 2002–04­). He is pursuing his doctoral research at the Berlage Institute Rotterdam on the topic of the dominant type and the city.Serie, founded in 2007 by Christopher C.M Lee and Kapil Gupta, is based in London, Mumbai, Beijing and Chengdu. The practice’s theoretical interest lies in the relationship between dominant types and the city. The practice works typologically – thinking and designing in series – and is committed to the projection of the cumulative intelligence of types into architectural projects. Serie theorises to practice and practices to enable theoretical speculations. Serie sustains this by teaching, writing and research in the AA and Berlage Institute. The works of Serie have been exhibited and published widely. Serie is recently nominated for the Iakov Chernikhov Prize 2010 for conceptual architecture and chosen as the 10 visionary architects for the new decade by the Leading European Architects Forum. Serie has also won numerous awards of excellence including BD Young Architect of the Year Award Runner-up 2008, and was selected by ICON Magazine as one of the world's 20 Essential Young Architects in the world.  www.serie.co.uk",

These external effects, namely the costs and benefits that are not recognised by traditional capitalist markets, are fundamental to the behaviour and structure of cities. The notion of Reflexive Urbanism builds upon Giddens’ concept of a reflexive modernity (1994). Using global examples and exemplary practices, the talk will speculate on the future of the city. It will suggest practical instruments for architects, developers and planners to value and stimulate positive externalities.

It is in the consumption of resources along with the current concentration and use of materials and energy that force-fields collide vis-à-vis the efficiency-targets set by governments, multinationals and organisations aiming for a cleaner economy. Nur Puri Purini will illustrate how environmental markets work now and how, in the context of green urbanisation, their healthy and increased development could help incentivise energy efficiency and a more mindful use of resources.The latest evolution of both Co2 markets and legislation as well as the obstacles ahead of us will be discussed. Energy and commodities consumption are also key in the context of urbanization, especially in the definition of energy balance sheets, future financing targets and impact on integrated urbanisation. To achieve tangible results, new standards are needed. Nur Puri Purini is an Italian national educated at the London School of Economics. He has ten years of professional experience accumulated between Italy and the UK as an economist and a financial analyst in international banks. After working shortly for Lehman Brothers in Italy, he worked for the Italian Government from 2002 to 2005 in the privatisation process. Based in London, Nur has worked as an energy and commodities specialist since October 2005.

        "detail": "A major new interpretive work on the structure of spatial experience, this book is for theorists of architecture, art and visual studies. It interprets the 15th-century demonstration of perspective for today by relating it to contemporary theories of subjectivity. It explores a link between architecture and psychoanalysis that has not hitherto been elaborated, and opens the way for the Lacanian critique of architecture that is now a familiar feature of discourse in the other arts and social sciences.The text argues that perspective is the paradigmatic form of spatial consciousness. This explains why perspective remains such a satisfying representational form – the form of space that we tend to call real – and why it remains the primary visual form of architectural space, despite recent experiments in representation that claim to challenge this canon. This link between the inner world of the psyche and the exterior world of architectural space is as fundamental as it is problematic, and is perhaps therefore inevitable.Lorens Holm is Reader in Architecture and Director of the Geddes Institute for Urban Research at the University of Dundee.

        "detail": "Brett Steele inaugurates the symposium noting the AA has transformed teaching of the past in architecture in fundamental ways and the problem of architectural history is particularly interesting at this moment within the school. Many students have articulated the straightforward point which is they have a problem understanding what to do with history in relation to their work in the studio. Architecture strangely tends to obsess with the future. The irony is that it has only defined itself in relation to the past, and architects are hired regarding past achievements. The culture of history that figures like Banham, Summerson, Pevsner, consolidated years ago, made possible that experimentation could situate itself in relation to something.Mark Cousins introduces the main aims of the conference, not concerned with history as it is taught in art history departments. It has a very precise focus: why for a long time the teaching of architectural history has been seen within the program as somewhat irrelevant. If one would like to be scholarly about this history of dissatisfaction, one would probably trace it back to the development of modernism itself. Modernism questioned the study the history of architecture, given the fact that it is the same thing you want to replace. The problem now is that modernism itself begins to have a history. The feeling of the irrelevance of history towards design practice together with the neglect of the history teacher dates from several decades ago and has been compounded by the introduction of the digital. It happens at an institutional level. It is not unfair to say that architecture history and its big narratives such as ‘from the Renaissance to the Baroque’ and so on, tend to be scholarly literature and have become very problematic. While teaching the Parthenon at the AA, we teach first of all an account of twentieth century architects’ reaction to the Parthenon. Cousins closes hoping that these issues would be discussed over the two days, knowing that the less we are concerned about the past, the less and less able we are to tackle the problems of architecture. At the AA there is a will to completely radicalize and transform the teaching of architectural history. He welcomes Reinhold Martin from Columbia.Reinhold Martin starts reminding the audience what they already know: that there is only history and nothing else. Secondly, to belief that computerization or digitalization as one of the main distractors of students from historical matters is in a sense historically inaccurate, because in the wider world, historians were just as, if not quicker than architects when it came to computing. As early as 1958, the Annales historian Fernand Braudel (1902-1985) was testing the application of game theory and social mathematics to the practice of history. By 1973, the digital computation of demographic statistics was shaping the professional practice of social history. To the point that Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie (1929-) could claim: “Tomorrow’s historian will be a computer program or it would no longer exist.” Although these unrelated developments have little influence on the writing of architectural history, they did influenced associated fields, such as urban and environmental history; palpable in the starring role that was played by the bankruptcy maps in William Cronon’s Nature’s Metropolis. The later offers a completely different, -but not entirely incompatible- picture of Chicago than that which is implied in the essay by Colin Rowe, Chicago Frame. Like digitalization more generally, early quantitative history was dominated by a characteristically mid-century desire to align historical knowledge to natural and social sciences. Though architecture is no stranger to this desire, the failure of architecture historians to take up the statistical methods pioneered with the help of computers by their colleagues in social history, correlates to the failure or refusal to render architectural history scientific. Historiographers have argued that social history’s incorporation to quantitative methods marks a zenith of century-long efforts to gain for history writing the authority of a science. This authority, a legacy of nineteenth century positivism, has been challenged since the 1960s on a number of grounds, to the extent that it is somehow an oxymoronic expression to say ‘history of science.’ Little history is taught in the science curricula, even more, the amount of PhD thesis on history in both architecture and science is ridiculously small when compared to the rest of the research developed. History, as a form of truth telling, partakes of the very same scientific authority it seems to relativize when it inserts science in the urban flow of contingency. The modern university begins with the nominal separation of power, of professional faculties like theology, law, or medicine, from those of knowledge or philosophy, together with what today we would call the arts and sciences. What would a laboratory with something like an historical consciousness look like? Scientifically speaking, the idea of an architecture school as a sort of laboratory in which experimental knowledge is generated for subsequent application in the outside world, also risks the ideological premise that there is a world out there passively awaiting the arrival of disinterested knowledge acquired in the academy. Architecture pedagogy can also be seen as a scientific laboratory experiment. How to teach architecture history to future architects: teach it as the best history of science is taught today: as the contestable accumulation of contingent truth. Students have no difficulty in imagining that certain things can change, but they have immense difficulty in imagining that all things can change. To a large extent, this lack of imagination is to blame to their post modern heritage. Historical consciousness is consciousness that things can change and they do change and therefore that one might actively pursue this structural transformation of the status quo rather than be content with postmodern modesty. The inquiry into how and why things change, must acknowledge that causality is anything but linear. There is no need to apologize for the uselessness of history. In architecture we must remember that normal science, in the kuhnian sense, takes place in the studio or laboratory as much as it does in the library. To rethink architecture’s relation to history is also to rethink the studio. And though it is not possible, or at least not advisable to teach history in the studio, it is possible to teach historical questions. Teaching history is hardly an academic exercise; it is in teaching as such, professional teaching, where the past returns every day without repetition. This eternal return of the past as a problem, rather than as a fully resolved fact, elicits a historical consciousness that lies at the very core of all future oriented architectural knowledge. That is what I mean in saying that there is only history and nothing else. For any end, what is historical about architecture, is the recurrent dispute about the proper arrangement of past, present and future, including who does the arrangement and to what end. It is from this irreducible historicity, replayed a little different each time, that both the discipline and the profession derive their authority, as well as their responsibility. Questions follow.The focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings. It is frequently admitted that architectural students do not find their history programmes useful or interesting. Why is this? The conference will address this question and consider how problems within architectural history might be productively changed by a different approach to the architectural past.The AA has sought to reformulate its syllabus of how the issue of the past is dealt with in architectural terms. The symposium will consider ways in which the issue of the architectural past can be fashioned into a productive element in the training of an architect.

        "detail": "Mark Cousins introduces the speaker, Eyal Weizman, praising his program at Goldsmiths, which has fostered in London, and in Britain in general, a much more systematic questioning in the realms of politics, human rights and territoires.Eyal aims to establish a relation of architecture and history through the term ‘forensics’. In that field, there is a certain history that is written by scientists. He introduces the term political plastic: space is a political plastic inasmuch as built forms and landscapes are continuously shaped and reshaped by political forces: translating those transformations into physical forms. The question then is whether it is possible to read backwards form into politics and into history. Also, if there is some sort of immediate transparency in it or, in the contrary, are we entering a field which is a little bit more complicated than that. Forensic architecture might be the frame in which we can question that relation between an analysis of form and an event. The question is how to unlock complex historical events from structures or from their remanences, a process that is not mediated by architecture history at all. He shows a mosque in Kosovo catalogued into its elements, that aroused a historical debate. There was a broadcasted meeting between the architectural historian, Andras Riedlmayer -world known expert in ottoman architecture- and Slobodan Milosevic. They discuss the destruction of the Hadum mosque; Milosevic suggests that the mosque had been destroyed by a bomb and the historian argues that the minarette was decapitated by a small caliber artillery, and it then fell into the building causing a series of other collapses. Both are reading different histories in the rubble, they take the ruin in their own terms. Milosevic continuously questions the historian’s ability to speak on behalf of the rubble, being that he is not a ballistic specialist or a structural engineer and therefore argues for some kind of skill missing. The court fails to give a verdict and so has happened in subsequent occasions. The problem was not convicting those people, but that the mosque was to be rebuilt by UNESCO, a UN body. At that point Eyal was asked by Riedlmayer himself to recreate the scenario. In international law, you need to prove the facts in 85%, that is the threshold of truth. They (Forensic Architecture) needed to provide a file in which they presented the cause of the destruction 95%. Finally, they realised they could not provide that certainty, but sent a sketch of two monuments, one next to the other, one saying that it was destroyed by certain nationalists; the other one describing the way it was destroyed by NATO. In the following years to this trial, architecture and its representations (plans, photographs) started to frequent the courts and media forums of international justice. The reasons are varied, on the one hand, war became a very urban phenomena, on the other hand, we had new technologies, like aerial satellite images. Forensic architecture as a practice is an analytical method for reconstructing events or histories inscribed in built environments. It seeks to turn a built structure from illustration to an epistemic resource. Until this moment, pictures of ruins and rubbles in international law just served as illustrations, nobody was looking into them until very recently. Besides, the object or the thing of the structure should not be seen in isolation, but as a part of a complex assemblage. Matter is under constant transformation and interlinking, so it should be taken as an entry to retrace networks of connections. Eyal is interested in extending the term forensics beyond the legal realm and through that discourse move on towards thinking the object in the making of history. In fact, the origins of the term forensics are not legal, but a part of rhetorics: not related to the speech of humans, but to the speech of things and mediated by humans. In forensics, things speak and take part in conversation. In latin rhetorics, the speech of things is called prosopopeia: a rhetorical device in which the orator would bring down the gods from heaven, evoque the dead, or give voices to states, objects, buildings and cities. Forensic archaeology, another emerging disciplines, together with forensic anthropology are huge disciplinary apparatuses, but both of them are barely two decades old. Clyde Snow, who investigated the remains of people in Tutankhamun's tomb, refers to his work as osteobiography, saying: “There is brief but very useful and a very informative biography of an individual contained within his skeleton, if you know how to read it. Bones make great witnesses, they speak softly, but they never forget and they never lie.” The idea that they “never lie” is something Eyal would like to contest; as to tell the truth, you don’t need to speak, because the minute you speak, obviously, you start lying. If material evidence is technically understood, then it is legally acknowledged as capable of speech; as witnesses of the non-human variety. Like this, we might need another extension of the term of forensics. Material evidence turns into material witness. Eyal discusses the statement of a collector of nazi memorabilia, who claimed that being a military geek made him a better investigator. It was obviously not understood like that in his circles. This situation  could lead to a tentative proposition, that forensics is a kind of fetish and that good forensic analysts are necessarily fetishist. Collateral damage estimations in military operations are not an abstract proportion of calculations, but a material practice that results in the configuration of physical strategies: the design of the ruin (by designing the ruin of a building one can estimate the casualties of one attack). The calculation of life and death is an engineering calculation of structural blast; forensic architecture is the relationship between that structural engineering and ethics. The violence of giving voice to the things is like torture, things are made to speak by subjecting them to additional violence. The field of forensics can be described as the torture of objects. He ends showing an archive of photographs of destroyed refugee camps in Gaza. Following a question from the audience, he discusses the crimes of drones: there is an international debate around what to do with the crimes of machines. He is interested in the possibility of doing history as you do design.The focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings.

        "detail": "Mark Cousins introduces Brian Hatton. While he begins to talk, a video made in the interior of John Soane museum is projected on the screen: he explains that for him, this museum is an early version of an hypertext museum. Two main concerns about history in architecture schools are: it is too dependent on stylistic models on art history and second that it seems unpopular among students. It certainly has been neglected by design teachers, particularly from the 1960s. From 1966, with Aldo Rossi’s Architecture of the City and Venturi’s Complexity and Contradiction in Architecture, a wave of historical revisions passed through the schools. Around 1990, models where drawn again by natural history, with topics such as self organizing, complexity and chaos theory, fractal and topological geometry. A catalyst for all this was the computer, CAD techniques and other analogs of natural processes. Parametric design techniques suggest that the wave is not yet down; very oddly, Patrick Schumacher declared parametricism to be the great new style in a recent manifesto that parodied the isms of 90 years ago. It there is a return to history at this point, it is possible to guess that there will be a revival of interest in George Kubler’s 1962 book, The shape of time, as his proposals for an evolutionary formalism are closer to a recent scientism. Heinrich Hübsch’s 1828’s question In what style should we build? proposes (wrongly, in Hatton’s view) first that there is a question about how to design, second that the answer would be found in some kind of style and third, that the correct style would be developed rationally, according to historical models. Thus, the past is turned into history. The study of history according to this vision, might induce to certain alienation in the students. In Stephen Dedalus' conversation with Mr. Deasy (from Ulysses) he claims “History is a nightmare from which I am trying to awake”. As the archeologies where organized and museums filled, the information overflow became entropic. And entropy, as testified from Piranesi to Robert Smithson, liberates an intoxicated imagination. In art, to realize disorientation is to consider another possible direction, as in Breton’s first surrealist anthology, Les pas perdus; the lost steps. Why one has to do academic study when what he really wants to know is, who am I? No history of art works is traceable without the appreciation of the works in sich, in themselves. That is, description precedes explanation. A diagram, a tetrahedron, with its four tips: theory, architecture, criticism and history represents well how each practice relies in the other three, that is, the architect sits on the triangle of theory, criticism and history, the historian in the other three and so on. None can be practiced without the others. I know of architects and artist who understand of art as well as a historian does, but their knowledge is as if it were synoptic rather than chronoptic. They see that history presents early, middle and late works, but not necessarily in that order to them, as they lean towards their own present height. We could imagine perhaps an open school, like Umberto Eco’s Opera Aperta, setting out not a stream, but a field of meaning, negotiated in multiple utterances and exchanges, but set out among certain stable forms. As Robin Evans said in one of his essays, \"today’s ubiquitous technique, including historical technique, provokes dreams of escape, that must stay as dreams, as a wish unfulfilled is a wish kept alive.\" Curriculum in a school is not to be a dogma, but a method. Exhibitions in museums may be like courses in disciplines, but critics of the conservative museum overlooked how visitors often treat fixed sequences of museum, rarely approaching them as a tome to be read from page 1 to that which says the end, but rather led by mood and open to detours of unexpected absorption. To a visitor, the historical time might be a grid against where to fix other figures, which may become an intuition of a new Gestalt or constellation. Such seemed to be an aim in the montages of trans-cultural images made by Aby Warburg, which he called his atlas of mnemosyne, memory. Gerhard Richter too, named Atlas his archive of photographs, which he collected for his use in painting. If a school might be compared with a museum and the exhibition may be more like a course, I suggest that in a way what the students end with its simply like the wrong atlas. Why do we make the course a re-course? Why in willing what we want to be, in the future, the recurrence to what it was? Why the museum at all? This questions are not to be thrown like a bomb to the academy, but considered, architecture is a mode of design, but many kinds of design are not studied through their history. In technology, progress renders earlier versions obsolete, but in art, expressivity remains immanent in every work. As Ezra Pound put it, art is news that stays news. But not all of it is read all the time, so art history is continuously rewritten with different eyes each time, not only in books but in every new work of art or architecture. Art has a history of histories, histories of practice, of theories, why cannot it be detached from those stories? Perhaps because art works as a precipitate of consciousness and as we can scarcely imagine consciousness without time, we cannot make sense of art works without recognizing them in relation to some past with which we can identify. Note the re in recognizing, for while cognizing renders shapes and colors; science and meanings come by recognizing, which means some learning modes are not only made of possible facts, but of possible fictions, which is to say, of representations. Of facts, we can make chronologies, but representations call for histories. History itself often turns out to be too susceptible to myths and dreams, which is why perhaps it is so often simplified to myth. If error and truth, danger and safety, circulate through each other, so do myth and history. If the architect does not seek out historical pasts, mythic past would seek the architect out. As soon as the design leaves the computer screen and goes to public site, it joins history, no longer a dream of a solitary wanderer. If the first purpose of education is to help the student towards their own identity, then the second might be to de-narcisisse the student of the illusion of uniqueness and lead towards what one might call the common life of historical identity. Questions follow.The focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings. It is frequently admitted that architectural students do not find their history programmes useful or interesting. Why is this? The conference will address this question and consider how problems within architectural history might be productively changed by a different approach to the architectural past.The AA has sought to reformulate its syllabus of how the issue of the past is dealt with in architectural terms.

        "detail": "Mark Cousins introduces Mark Campbell, who presents a paper on the historian Geoffrey Scott. It is interesting to discuss Scott’s architecture of humanism in the context of this conference, as it is a very traditional and very English topic; also quite an absurd one. Scott’s work begins to ask one central question: what is it to write bad history? Amongst other things, Scott is a terrible historian; or he is more interesting when he is inaccurate. He quotes The Man Without Qualities of Robert Musil, to possibly define the pass of history: “the course of history resembles the movement of clouds, or the path of a man through the street, turn aside by a shadow here, a crowd there, until he arrives at a place which he never knew or meant to go.” Scott’s treatise, The Architecture of Humanism: A Study in the History of Taste (1914) occupies an unusual position in the genealogies of nineteenth century histories of architecture. To Scott, the past only suggested a direction for the future, because the future entailed a mere continuation of the immediate past. His take on the phenomenon known as the battle of the styles in his time, was that whether there might be a lack of architectural taste, there was certainly not a lack of opinion. Berenson was known by his very acute eye, he was an expert in the recognition of Renaissance paintings. Scott is fascinating because of his relatively biographical anonymity. His work is more one of accidental history, than of connoisseurship. The incidental nature of Scott’s History of Taste is what makes it intellectually interesting. In Reyner Banham’s terms: “must have happened elsewhere.” Moreover, although Scott conceived the present and the future in terms of the restoration of the past, he also realized that history itself consisted in something less reasonable, of a series of accidents or incidental occurrences, failed plans and misunderstandings. The one question that Scott would consciously fails to address is what role does the historian should take in treating those layers of circumstances, to discover what lies beneath. What is remarkable about the work of Giovanni Morelli, was his concentration on those details and gestures which lie beyond the artist’s conscious control, when the artist somehow forgot himself. For Carlo Ginzburg, Morelli is in affinity with the techniques of the criminologist, as he proposes a diagnostic structure in which nothing was incidental. In Theory and Design in the First Machine Age, Banham noted how Scott’s work was the most interesting product in the English discourse of the time. revealing against the insularity and self-referentiality of late Victorian architecture. According to Banham, Scott introduced the concept of space in the anglo-american discourse, which he drew from his interpretation of German aesthetics. Scott’s history always occurs in the footnotes. When he addressed an audience, in the late 1970s, Colin Rowe placed Scott’s definition of psychologically invested space as the centre of his architectural thought. For Banham, Rowe was the most un-groupie of all groupie people. Berenson has a point in saying that Scott’s conception of architecture is overly literal, as becoming a two dimensional surface. Scott professed his preference for an ideal margin between him and the facts, in which to move without affecting the situation. Questions follow. Mark Cousins intervenes, saying that it is almost possible to do a digest of the last century architecture by tracing the following line: Scott, and how he was misread by Wittkower. And that misreading was misread by Colin Rowe, and Rowe’s misreading was then (mis)read by Peter Eisenman. The last misreader would be Greg Lynn.The focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings. It is frequently admitted that architectural students do not find their history programmes useful or interesting. Why is this?

        "detail": "Mark Cousins presents Jeffrey Kipnis as a great teacher of architecture, who came to AA to start the graduate design courses. He claims to be indifferent to the problems of hard history; however, he benefits from it and relies on it entirely. He claims to I admire it, but just don’t like to read it. He wants to address the question of how do we teach history. He states he is a hard pedagogue, he believes in adults, children, even if they don’t behave like one would expect. A good way to teach children is through brute force and repetition. Jeff points out an oddity in Bedford square: the four temple-front buildings, and their uncanny treatment of the classical rules of composition. When he started teaching architecture, he questioned whether architecture is something you can teach and studied the pedagogical histories of other disciplines. Some of them have a very strong pedagogy, like chemistry. Not physics, in that field every great physicists has studied with other great physicists, and so happens with mathematicians. Music has a great pedagogy, painting has no pedagogy whatsoever, there is virtually no relation between the quality of a painting and that of their education. Jeff refers to the talks of the previous day, pointing that there is a big difference between power and authority. Authority is the ability to force someone to bend their will. Power is actually the capacity of making someone to act on your behalf through their will. He does not believe that architectural facts work through demonstration, but through seduction, trickery, subterfuge; they are much more like powers. When you are writing a theory you are basically proposing a way of teaching something differently. A ‘good pedagogue’ is someone who takes the work of geniuses, writes it down into exercises, so that it can be disseminated as mediocrity, hoping that in this process new geniuses might arouse. [Showing a painting by Roy Lichtenstein] He went to NY to write a painting criticism. He claims that as nobody was writing contemporary architecture criticism, he could immediately be the best in the world. He got interested by how the decisions of curators are made, what is better about one painting that another one. Jeff then analyzes one of the last paintings of the artist, indicating how he copied the style of seven different painters. He claims to be interested in the building, not so much in the interpretation of the building. As in the Wolfflinian method, the relationship between a painting and another painting is more interesting than the relationship between a painting and a central issue. If you want to do a good painting of an apple, should you eat an apple or look at another painting of an apple? Generally, you can convince someone to copy another painting and point out that every tiny difference is a manifestation of tremendous freedom. Derrida formulated an argument about this: a copy produces the original as the original. A good interpreter can ruin anything: so he got interested on how to work on the techniques to produce effects. So the whole issue of the pedagogy of history is governed by that problem. Mark and Jeff himself began to write a paper about the role of architecture criticism and they took as a premise that it is pointless to criticise a building or a project in architecture like you would a movie or a book or a painting because basically, that kind of criticism and that kind of judgement has to do with the consumption. By the time that the building is built, what can you do? Lets say that there is a terrible critic on a building: what can you do, leave it? or don’t look at it anymore, tear it down? They had this idea about the good critic: someone that can perform a building for an audience, even if that performance has nothing to do with the architectural intention. The job of the critic is to add something to it and to bring it to life. Being interested in architectural effects, Jeff conducted a research project with his students on what were the client-articulated values for a new building, naming seven: codes (safety, stability, viability) cost, comfort, convenience, familiarity, pride, pleasure (the first three of them are regulated by law). He points out how unimportant are those values for students during their architectural education. The reason why architects do not pursue that in their own work is simple: they are easy. Clearly, an architect interested in architectural effects is not going to be interested in those seven effects, to the point he would not even call them like that, but building effects. In American housing, a main issue is how close you can get the kitchen to the garage. This kind of issues, might be called dental issues, how to do it right. An architect should be good at this before moving on onto anything else. He describes his interest in architectural effects as an interest in misbehaviour, that derives not so much from democracy, but freedom. Freedom is an ‘aeffect’ caused by the removal of undeserved authority. Architecture has a very good capacity to put you in the right mood, attitude and behaviour for the institutional character you are in: you tend to shut up. He addresses Gehry’s proposal for the museum in Andorra, seeing how he addresses the local architecture, but avoiding repetition. He draws a comparison with the proposal of the firm R&Sie for an art gallery in Bangkok, with a facade made of dust. He names this as a new contextualism. If you look at Venturi’s facade for the national gallery, you can see that it is utterly banal. Then you can question: is he stupid? Are there good reasons to do a banal project for the National Gallery? He shows a photograph of building by Will Alsop, saying that he does not like him as a painter (treating the image shown as a painting). He decides to do an archaeology of the building and try to find where do its elements come from, ranging from Villa Savoye and Plug-in city to a painting of St. George killing a dragon. Finally, he presents a diagram of the political history of the world through a series of words, slavery - serfdom - blind obedience, saying that it was a great period of architecture, the period of royalty, church, totalitarian, general oppression: the most clients, the most prestige. Then, there was this obeying and behaving period we call modernism, when we were okay. But after it, it comes this misbehaving period (Peter Eisenman, Rem etc); those have a peak, but are generally unhappy architects. Jeff defends the position right in between behaving and misbehavin: “Ain’t misbehavin.” Questions follow. During the conversation, Jeff expresses his worry about the notion of truth-telling in history, as opposed to option-making. He also claims not to care about the lives of people in buildings, as they are basically going to be okay (meaning dry, fairly comfortable and so on). There is a whole lot of people who do an excessive emphasis on the effects of architecture. Mark points as an acute problem in the AA, should the teacher be giving “””””a teaching””””” or should they be teaching? What is the difference between saying “students are invited to come to a design unit -or other form of non-design work- on the ground that you would like to gain something from a teaching” or, on the other hand, is the institution going to set some kind of norms in terms of expectancies, syllabuses etc. which are to be delivered by teaching. In that sense, there is a very distinct tension between a teaching and teaching. He closes doing a remark on how aware are students on their rights, not so much as citizens of the AA, but more as consumers. ",

        "detail": "MARK COUSINS: I’m Mark Cousins and I teach. Being a teacher is kind of despised by everybody, specially students. I am going to condense the argument, which can sound as a historical argument, but might be as well treated as a logical argument: a series of axioms which have several consequences. I will make two related propositions: that architecture started in the nineteenth century, and there is nothing architectural outside the scope of that discourse and practice. It spreads, until it becomes a system that terminates in modernity. I am forced to use the term modernity, which I do not particularly like, but it solves the issue ok talking about one nation, the East, the West, rich poor etc. In that sense, architecture is a modern practice, not derived from a culture, because of this we have the problems with history which we have been talking about. They are not historical problems about architecture, but problems which are generated by a new practice called architecture in the nineteenth century, which needs to project the concept, the name, the category of architecture across time and across space. Now, very confusingly, we have texts called, for instance, the history of housing, which very mechanically start by saying that since the beginning of time, human being needed shelter and therefore architecture. That is very baffling, as a lot of people do not have shelter. There was a very funny piece by Mark Twain that revisits the issue of Adam’s house in paradise, by having Adam wake up in a kind of American National park and he is fine until he receives the proposal of cutting trees and having a dwelling. The whole piece is about his lament for this situation. Architecture is a nineteenth century invention. Some might have read Michel Foucault’s study, ‘The Birth of the Clinic’: his concern is that when we say medicine, we mean modern medicine, and it is a system a practical and conceptual arrangement in which something like this appears: that the figure of a doctor emerges. The place, is the hospital, because it becomes the place of the treatment of patients, but more than that it becomes the archive of medical knowledge, it becomes the site of the trainment of doctors. It will be soon linked to higher education. Part of the trainment is done under the roof of the University. The doctor himself is therefore linked to a series of professional relationships, regulated by a professional body, part of it consists in delegitimizing competitors. It will be recognized that medicine is such a nineteenth century invention. It cannot be reduced to an essence, it’s an articulation, it’s an ensemble, that is medicine in Modernity. Of course there are certain regions and cultures which have their own knowledge of the body, and of healing methods, but they are not, as to say, part of modern medicine. Modern medicine has a logic that includes certain things and excludes others. I propose to apply the same analysis to architecture. Architecture in the nineteenth century involves the following elements: the push to establish architecture as a profession, a new type of status within the capitalist system, it is consistent with it, but self-consciously not reducible simply to the sale of goods and services. It develops forms of training, which soon become linked to the University, so it becomes a professional matter inasmuch an educational matter. It demands more books about architects, journals. The same could be applied to law and the lawyer. Foucault in ‘The Archaeology of Knowledge’ says something really interesting about the rise of modern practices and discourses: although they’re established in this specific way, they immediately seek to acquire a greater cultural legitimacy and prestige by adorning themselves with an ancient history. So, the rise of architectural history in the nineteenth century is not testimony so much to the scholarly inquire into the architecture of the past, but to decorate architecture with the legitimacy of it. There are intellectual rights over the use of the word architecture. Everything is now architecture. The problem of architectural history it is not the history of the world’s buildings, but its struggle is a search for legitimacy. In terms of creating a profession for themselves, architects fail to have the monopoly that doctors or lawyers have. It could hardly be over design in general, it could hardly be over the building, so there is a black hole. What architects have managed to establish is: we are the only ones who can open an architecture office. It brings more obligations that rights. This could be extended to that argument in anthropology or post-colonial cultural studies; the countries where architecture arises tend to be also colonizing countries. That architecture is treated as a sort of colonialist architecture, which seeks to repress other architectures. When arguing that other architectures can’t be called architectures is not to derogate the status, or to claim that they have less value, but simply saying they’re not architecture. Like China, that has ancient imperial building traditions, a wide spread of vernacular building traditions, but began having ‘architecture’ when started sending people to study to the University of Pennsylvania, at the beginning of the twentieth century, where they received a Beaux Arts education: that’s what they brought back to China and that is Chinese architecture in that century. As an example, he explains his discussion with a professor of Mumbai on the syllabus of a completely standard course on the history of architecture. In addition to the classical evolution from Greek and Roman to Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance etc, he proposed to add two chapters at the end: Muslim and Hindu architecture, which are not taught in England. The demand, was to have more Hindu architecture. So, one scratches one’s head and says, yeah, but what is it? The books on Hindu architecture are done by British colonialists who tried to forge an image, a pattern and an account on Hindu architecture, based on the idea that all architectures were versions of the classical orders. So they had the hindu orders. Instead of treating this as an anachronistic colonialist fantasy, it was actually becoming the blueprint for nationalism. In that sense, I regard the term Hindu architecture as anachronistic, and coming from a will to insist in two things: that architecture is eternal, and infinitely variable. Singular and diverse. A lot of what I think of as architectural history it should not be conceived as that, but as the history of building traditions, across cultures. But we do not have to try to find a practice which is universal and utterly distinct. I would accuse those people who want ever more broad definitions of world architecture to be guilty of some sort of anachronism. That is the reason why so many fights on architecture schools take the form of a fight on the term architecture itself. The task in the mid-nineteenth century was to generate for the profession a mode of legitimacy which they called historical. Any school who wants to be validated needs to teach architecture history. But if you were looking for the reason why do you want this, you would be lacking of any coherent argument. They would mention humanistic examples, the good examples, to “use in the future”. Lets look at the resources they had in the mid 19th century for converting 18th century discourses on the history of building into the history of architecture. No one said in the first century BC, looking at a building what do you think of it architecturally? They had (in the 19th c.) a certain type of writing which is quite new, in someone like Burckhardt who produced in his book on the Italian Renaissance, a sort of poor man’s hegelianism. There, he wanted to unify the Renaissance as a distinct cultural form, a type: it emerged it died. But, above all, a unity. Then, in the task of describing a regime of heterogenous elements like building, painting, sculpture… you will end up stressing that they all share a certain style. Thus, Burckhardt invents for the modern period the notion of a distinct historical entity, characterized as style. This was developed by Wolflin, in terms of developing a notion of the Renaissance and then of the Baroque, establishing a kind of typification of regimes of style. What we mean by style, is understood as the five things that according to Wolflin characterize Renaissance as opposed to the Baroque. That comes to define a lot of general history of architecture, and it is still the basis of our misleading teaching of architecture as a succession of stylistic regimes. It is fair to say that this way of teaching also has its criticisms and that architectural history, as well as general art history has removed from the debates over the status of history and historical knowledge. Starting from the gradual dissolution of an overall concept of history as being a specific type of object with a form of knowledge that appeared in France in the 60s. There is a radical critique which has never been answered, by Lewis Strauss, who the commonly accepted task that everyone has to be historian, and history is ‘what matters’, and called this ‘historicity’. That is to say, that the representation of the past and the significance of that past to what we do now is a feature of some societies and not others. Western societies are ones which pays strong value on historicity. Secondly, the category of history itself could be summarized in three utterly dogmatic statements. We moved from a situation with Hegel when history is a process with a subject. The radical modification in the 1960s came from the marxist philosopher Louis Althusser, who said that history is a process without a subject. Then, it was radicalized by Michel Foucault, who said “history is not a process”. This succession reveals that history does not exist as an agent, and does not exist coherently as a concept. Finally,  there are two things that are opposed to each other: history on the one hand and the past on the other. Each of you has a history but each of you has a past. Your history is living in your cv, but when someone is looking at their cv, it is common to say: it’s not so bad (optimistically), but it has nothing to do with me. It represents nothing. There is something else we have which is not historically represented: it is what psychoanalysis might call your past. The past is not governed by the same economy, it does not have the same kind of being as a history. The past is not about events that have some external register, it cannot relate to this sort of independent truth-table. If you talk about your past honestly (I’m not saying anybody does that, only maybe in psychoanalysis) all you are doing is talking about a set of problems. If you had no problems, you wouldn't have a past. There would be nothing to reflect on, because we can only reflect on what it is an obstacle. My proposition is that the idea of the past is not an alternative to a history which would include everything; it is defined by being a problem. The pointlessness to students of a lot of survey history is that it is just like reading out loud the cv of architecture. If we began to explore the idea of architecture’s past, this past would be different, it would be the past which gives it problems. From this vantage point, the first problem addressed is the form of the matter in hand. So, it is possible to say that the collective investigation of the past is a practice of identifying what architecture’s problems are, which then are gradually systematically uncovered, by finding each iteration of this problem. Maybe part of the problem is being a profession at all. Therefore you could easily nominate ten problems that exist in the AA, like the fact that we have never discussed the effects of the introduction of the digital in the school. Following this things through, the kernel of the problem can be reached and then exposed. Perhaps we can reinvent a student interest in what we would place in the place of architectural history which will perform that task of increasing sensitivity to the discourse and practice of architecture without having to continue in the same rather repetitive and sterile fashion.\nQuestions follow. During the questions, Mark points out that the only criticism of Rogers, Foster and so on to the Prince of Wales in their discussions is the norms and regulations. He considers this to be an extraordinarily weak, self-interested objection. Berlusconi was the one who first realized that the way to victory is simply to make the population stupid. In teaching, if someone wants to offer something like a new kind of survey, they should be able to test it, I think that it is going to be remarkably like the old one.\n\nThe focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings. It is frequently admitted that architectural students do not find their history programmes useful or interesting. Why is this? The conference will address this question and consider how problems within architectural history might be productively changed by a different approach to the architectural past.\nThe AA has sought to reformulate its syllabus of how the issue of the past is dealt with in architectural terms. The symposium will consider ways in which the issue of the architectural past can be fashioned into a productive element in the training of an architect. Schedule: Friday 21 May10.30 Brett Steele (Director of AA), Welcome10.45 Mark Cousins (AA), Introduction 11.00 Reinhold Martin (Columbia University), Professional Histories 12.00 Brian Hatton (AA and John Moores University), Wandering in the Museum 2.00 Adrian Forty (Bartlett School, UCL) Dissecting the Cadaver 3.00 Irene Sunwoo (Princeton University), The Static Age 3.45 Panel discussion on Archives and Publishing, Tom Weaver (AA Files), Edward Bottoms (AA Library) and Irene Sunwoo 4.30 Tea5.00 Eyal Weizman (Goldsmiths) Forensic Architecture: only the criminal can solve the crime Saturday 22 May10.30 Mark Campbell (AA)11.30 Jeff Kipnis (Ohio State University), Honour Thy Bungling Epigone12.30 Lunch2.00 Mark Cousins (AA), Architecture and its Unconscious3.00 Panel discussion, Mollie Claypool (AA), Ryan Dillon (AA) and AA students.\n",

        "detail": " Mark invites the panel to present themselves. Mollie Claypool introduces herself as a teacher at the AA, both in DRL and in third year HTS; also at the University of Reading. Ryan Dillon follows, who also teaches in DRL and in first year HTS, and is working for EGG Office, a design firm in Los Angeles. Jack Self, second year student. Braden Engel, from North Dakota, former student of MA HCT, who is tutor in that program (2010) and Histories and Theories tutor at the University of Greenwich. Finally, Eleanor Dodman is also in second year. Mollie starts going back to the discussion on the archive, where she sees a lot of potential in the possibility they bring for students to find gaps or look for histories that unnecessarily were forgotten. In HTS, they address sixteen iconic buildings, not through a survey course, but in a very straight forward way, allowing student to talk about the differences, rather than discussing the things that they represent. Ryan refers to the disconnexion between the work of the studio and the history teaching; for him teaching is not so much about giving a catalogue, but about inviting students to utilize the past, manipulate it and see the link between what they are doing. Jack, mentions a sentence he read recently of Rancière, saying that “art is always a political act”. The concern of history and theory about what we might call architecture as art, rather than architecture as a technological expression, it understood because architecture as art, is the politics of space. He argues that the mistake made by a lot of unit masters is a separation of art as a formal activity from art as a political statement. He sees history and theory as a microcosms for a challenge that architecture as a profession is facing at the moment: the decline in interest in history and theory has got very little to do with the historians or the theoreticians, it has to do with the fact that it is not valued by unit masters and therefore not seen as relevant by the students who are partaking in those studios. He is referring to a-political units. The architect as a figure in society, if they wish to avoid obsolescence, it has to convince society of their political role. Eleanor intervenes, pointing out that it is up to the student whether or not hey combine their history and theory with the unit work. They are possible to combine at least in her case. The question to Braden it is still how architecture is tacked between the student and the tutor, as opposed to someone like a teacher. Mark wonders who in architectural history would fit in the AA: maybe not Wren, but Hawksmoor yes. Jack point out that the teaching of history in AA somehow relies in its opposition towards what everyone else is teaching. All architects think they are theorists, they are wrong, but how would they know.  The focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings. It is frequently admitted that architectural students do not find their history programmes useful or interesting. Why is this?

        "detail": "3/9 Adrian Forty Dissecting the CadaverMark Cousins introduces Adrian Forty, who announces a very pragmatic talk; not offering thoughts about the nature of truth, the past, time or any of the other big questions. At the start of every academic year, he finds himself in front of an audience of 150 of new students and he presents to them a course on the history of Architecture and Cities, feeling that he has to offer some explanation as to why they are having a history course. He says to them that they are young people, going to school in order to make new things, so why should they be concerned with the past? Surely, he reminds, it is only declining civilizations that become obsessed with the past. Memories are the last refuge of those who are getting old, who have nothing else to look forward to. He finds it a very interesting question, which he has never fully satisfied himself, but in that situation in the beginning of the year, he feels he has to provide certain answers. One of them, is to do with the nature of the subject that they are concerned with; buildings and cities. He thinks it is useful to think about how study of architecture and the city differs from other disciplines. If one takes some disciplines, like engineering or economics, the knowledge in those fields consists of a body of theory, which people learn and which they learn how to reply in given situations. Architecture and building are not like that; the knowledge in architecture and building consists in the buildings and cities that are there. This is not to say that we can’t have theories about them, but ultimately the text about those theories is what is actually there. If you want to know what a wall is, or an opening is, you have to look, in a sense at all walls and at all openings. The knowledge is in the objects. This seems to him to put architecture apart from other theoretically based disciplines and more like some others, like medicine. In medicine, knowledge is ultimately knowledge of the body: there are theories on how the body works, but those theories are only good if they correspond with the experience, the physiognomy and the processes of the body. Taking the analogy further, what you do if you are a medical student is that you are presented with a dead body, a cadavre and you have to dissect it. You spend your first three months taking it apart, slowly, methodically, recording everything that you see. That is the beginning. There is some kind of equivalent that is needed for students of architecture and the cities, they too, need to know what the material in which they are operating is. In one way, it could be said that the best possible thing to do is a year-long grand tour, in which they see as much as it is possible in the space of a year. Maybe, it would be one solution to it. However, there are certain drawbacks to that as a way to presenting an education, he is not sure if it would really work, because it is not only about going to see something, but, what do you see when you get there? We probably all have the experience of going to a supposedly great work of architecture and finding that when we get there, we feel like, what is this all about? What is in it? You go away, puzzled and you write that off: perhaps it is not so great after all. The problem is that we don’t have any innate, natural ability to read buildings and cities; they are notoriously resistant to understanding, they don’t give up their meanings easily. Certainly, it wouldn't be possible to expect that those arriving at the school of architecture at the age of eighteen, however bright and well educated they might be, have the means to make sense of what they are seeing, even if the professor got them to see all these works around the world. There is a need to give people the apparatus, with which to make sense of what they see. This capacity to see and realize that buildings can carry thoughts, is something for which people have to acquire a skill. A history course provides some means in order to make sense of what people see. How does one do that, there are many possibilities. But I wonder how many students have made the journey to visit St. George’s Bloomsbury church, which is 4 min walk from AA. There is a kind of agoraphobia that is set among architecture students. In which their focus on their laptops, in their place in the studio and have a kind of terror of going out and seeing anything. One of the main challenges of teaching in a school of architecture, for Adrian, it is actually getting people out of the school of architecture, and to confront solid matter out there. Part of the task of the architecture course is to make people to feel relaxed about engaging with actual buildings and the city. So, what should we teach? He gives a scenario: we have a design tutor, giving a tutorial to one student. At one point, the tutor mentions one architect or building, Luis Barragan, Beauvais cathedral, which the student has not heard of, and it seems that the history teacher has failed to deliver this particular iconic work, which everybody should know of. This puts a rather heavy demand upon the teachers of history, and it is impossible to satisfy this expectation of dozens of design teachers, each of who have their own particular constellation that may depend on their formation, education, or particular preoccupations, which is perfectly understandable. But the difficulty is to expect that a formalized education can reproduce this obsessions. So, what one teaches is in a way arbitrary, things that you are interested in, that you happen to find more important and in a way it does not really matter what actually is provided. The formation of that cannon is arbitrary, contestable and provisional, as it changes all the time.Opening up the round of questions, Mark Cousins points out that the professionalization of the training of architecture is based on the belief amongst historians that students must know a wider range of buildings than those that they could possibly experience. This introduces another layer, in some sense, the foundation of architecture schools and their historical programs as founded in a photographic archive. So, the problem it is not only inside the building or outside, but on the photographs; the consequences of this have not really been elucidated. The Warburg institute in the 70’s, had a magnificent photographic library, largely of images chosen because of their iconographic significance. Gradually, some younger teachers there addressed the question, shouldn't the photographic library become coloured and remove those black and white photographs. Some scholars were radically opposed to this: color is extremely confusing, when trying to read the iconological significance. One very famous old iconographer said that he really wished that the whole of Western art was in black and white, because it would be so much easier for the study of iconography. Marks asks about the mediation of photography, which is extended to that of the computer.Adrian remembers a similar discussion at Courtauld Institute roughly at the same time that that signaled by Mark at Warburg. There were also those who argued very strongly for the preservation of black and white, as offering in some sense a truer representation of paintings in color, which was really baffling. What it brings up is that whatever we do in the Institutions, what history is about is to provide surrogates for the objects. What is it that we study, the representations of the objects or the objects themselves. The objects themselves are actually much more difficult to study than the surrogates. What the student learns from the cadavre is anatomy, the body. What they don’t learn about it is the living awakeness. Physiology, the study of the living body is dealt with in some other way. I’ve been trained as a historian, so I am not so sympathetic to the view that we live in a kind of eternal present and objects are different things at different times. History is about the past but is made in the present. What we are looking at is the many presents in which it has been made.Thanks to digital media it is now possible to find out what more or less any work in the world looks like and often to find some basic things about it. Mark Cousins adds that the computer is hostile to any critical awareness of the medium in which the information is delivered. Adrian continues saying that what schools of architecture teach is not building, is how to make images and representations. History is only one way of knowing about architecture, I wouldn’t make any claims for it being the only way of thinking about architecture. The focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings. It is frequently admitted that architectural students do not find their history programmes useful or interesting. Why is this? The conference will address this question and consider how problems within architectural history might be productively changed by a different approach to the architectural past.The AA has sought to reformulate its syllabus of how the issue of the past is dealt with in architectural terms.

        "detail": "Mark Cousins introduces Irene Sunwoo, relating her talk to ways other than teaching in which the past enters the schools of architecture, such as an interest for the institution itself. Irene introduces her current PhD research topic, which traces Alvin Boyarsky’s pedagogical theories and projects and his most known project: the AA, where he was chairman between 1971 and 1990. What she does is not a straightforward institutional history, nor a biography but rather tracing the ways in which pedagogy becomes a primary agent within architectural culture. I am presenting a part of the thesis on the uses of media in the 1970s in the AA. She begins with a short clip of Cedric Price in an episode of ‘Archimags’ of 1975 broadcasted in TV AA, in which he makes an account of the magazines he is reading. Irene underlines Cedric’s preference for photographs of the architectural process above those of built work. Television provides one lens for interrogating a cross fertilization of pedagogy, architecture and media practices at the AA during the 1970s. The school’s internalization of such practices led to an implosion of both media and architectural education. The photograph showing Alvin Boyarsky at the AA, shows the chairman behind his desk, overflowing papers: it can be read as a reflection of the way in which he understood education, as a well-laid table. Certainly, when he started at the AA, Alvin was no stranger to the camera’s eye, during the second half of the 1960s in Chicago, Boyarsky had supplemented his teaching duties with a series of short instructional television programs. He made an effort there to learn the medium. Furthermore, in the winter of 1965, Boyarsky participated in a series of television programs: ‘Masterbuilders: Implications of Change in Architectural Ideas’ with a lecture on Le Corbusier entitled ‘Towards an Architecture.’ The direct translation of the lecture format into the TV series, aroused harsh criticism for not having been able to exploit the actual process of television itself. Irene draws a comparison between the Bauhaus program represented in a wheel with concentric divisions and the AA events list, which in her view offers the quintessential diagram of Alvin’s post-modernist reconfiguration of architectural education as a process of selection rather than prescription. With its comprehensive diary of workshops, seminars, television programs, exhibitions, film screenings, lectures and courses the document acted as a kind of menu or program guide. We might be reminded of Habermas’ discussion over traffic in news emerging in tandem with a traffic in commodities. The events list is also a script for the school’s community, structuring the institution’s overwhelming number of activities and thus provoking a perpetual dissolution of educational process into a multiplicity of trajectories and destinations. In the 14th issue of the events list, it is announced the launch of TV AA, which will be shown on monitors all over the school. The communications department was then established. In TV AA were carried along in various formats, however it was in its earliest years, roughly between 1974 and 1976, when its identity was the strongest and its programming was at its most diverse. In December 1973, AA tutor David Green had articulated the value of such an undertaking, announcing that editing and video techniques were explored in his unit. Green also speculated on the TV system in the AA would offer “new possibilities for changing the academic structure” suggesting that the production and international distribution of video could initiate a broader learning network. A resource to be harnessed and manipulated, video, he contended, is not a magic wand, it is a tool. By the mid 1970s, television and video were already deeply embedded in avant-garde artistic practices. The AA came to embody the radicalization of institutional practices and the institutionalization of radical practices. In his 1964 book, Understanding Media, McLuhan begins his chapter on television by claiming that the child accustomed to watching television, struggles when confronted with static, printed information. Irene relates this to Walter Benjamin’s description of the horizontal plain of the book or as opposed to dictatorial perpendicular of newspapers, films and advertisements. From the surface of the table to the surface of the page and to the eliminated surface of the screen, the school’s multiple horizons seem to be projected in multiple dimensions, leaving the student without a straight path, yet bounded by resolute but perhaps imperceptible pedagogical limits.Roundtable discussion with Edward Bottoms, Mark Cousins, Irene Sunwoo and Tom Weaver. The later points out that history has become more and more a history of the immediate past, which in a way reinvents the model of architectural writing: not simply in third person, but adopting conversational terms. Edward Bottoms talks of the archive as a morgue, making reference to Adrian Forty’s lecture, where the cadavres are being cut up. The archive as a space of dead certainties. Adrian Forty intervenes saying that people normally go to the archive with a particular question in mind and with the expectation that the material found will provide some sort of answer. However, the attitude should be of listening to the archive, to hear what the archive wants to tell you. Most archives have been produced and organized for some particular purpose, they have their own peculiar structure and gaps and that is what you want to hear. Thus Adrian Forty poses a question to the panel: what is that the archive of the AA has to say to us, what is his own particular oracle. Mark answers: when the students identify certain people as being interesting and famous architects from 35 years ago, if they see what courses they were taking, they would be surprised by how historical that was. It is surprising to see that when people deliberately constituted themselves as oppositional or avant-gardist in the mid 70s, that took a political form that was also historical.The focus of the symposium is on the teaching of architectural history within architectural trainings. It is frequently admitted that architectural students do not find their history programmes useful or interesting. Why is this? The conference will address this question and consider how problems within architectural history might be productively changed by a different approach to the architectural past.The AA has sought to reformulate its syllabus of how the issue of the past is dealt with in architectural terms.

Can innovative software like Grasshopper be the ideal platform to marry computation, creativity and ecologic thinking? What can be done to accelerate the process?’This lecture by Grasshopper developer David Rutten and some of his independent collaborators will engage with these questions, introducing the history and ideas behind this novel parametric modelling software as well as some of its experimental future plug-ins operating at the borderline of geometry, mathematics, physics and biology.The lecture has been curated by Marco Poletto (Inter10 Unit Master) and is part of the Advanced Conceptual Design Workshop series held by ecoLogicStudio in London.For more information, go to http://www.simplyrhino.co.uk/about/AA.html",

The centres are a new mixed building type for healing that have different roots in the past. The ‘architecture of hope’ refers to this emergent hybrid genre, consisting of various metaphors that correspond to the many different types of cancer and their various treatments.Named after Maggie Keswick and co-founded with her husband Charles Jencks, Maggie’s Centres have been designed by Richard Murphy, Page and Park, Frank Gehry, Zaha Hadid and Richard Rogers. Further projects include buildings by Richard MacCormac, Piers Gough, Wilkinson Eyre and Rem Koolhaas.Charles Jencks lectures, writes and designs in the USA, the UK and Europe. He is the author of the best-selling The Language of Post-Modern Architecture (re-issued as The New Paradigm in Architecture, 2002) and numerous other books on contemporary arts and building, most recently The Architecture of Hope with Edwin Heathcote (Frances Lincoln 2010). His celebrated garden in Scotland is the subject of The Garden of Cosmic Speculation (Frances Lincoln, 2003). He won the Gulbenkian Prize for Museums for his design, Landform Ueda. ",

        "detail": "The Second World War is still considered today by most architectural histories as a hiatus, and consequently, remains an under-documented chapter. However, episodes leading from the bombings of Guernica to Hiroshima have been fundamental to the process of modernization and have led to the dominance of modernism in architecture. Architecture's contributions extended from new forms of infrastructure and management of masses to its engagement in the development of offensive and defensive tactics. The experience of architects on the frontlines, on the home front, and in wartime preparation for peacetime reconstruction and commemoration will also be considered.  Trained as an architect and historian in Paris, Jean-Louis Cohen has taught in Europe and North America. He is since 1994 professor at New York University¹s Institute of Fine Arts, and set up between 1998 and 2003 the Paris Cité de l'architecture et du patrimoine. His research has focused on twentieth century architecture and urban planning in France, Russia, Germany and North Africa, resulting in numerous exhibitions and publications on both sides of the Atlantic. Among his many books are Le Corbusier and the Mystique of the USSR (1992), Scenes of the World to Come (1995), Casablanca, Colonial Myths and Architectural Ventures (2002) and Above Paris (2006).",

It aims to expand the field of knowledge at the school through staging events. The nature of the cultural environment is engaged as an energetic force of production. For this reason the POA systematically collaborates with various parts of the wider AA community to actualise a wide, but focused, range of events. As part of the POA’s institutional enterprise, each event is accompanied by two paper publications, one preview and one review. These will form the basis of the POA public archive.\nIain SinclairGhost Milk (Calling Time on the Age of the Grand Project)Tuesday 23 February, 6.00 Lecture Hall\n‘Expeditions in the Lower Lea Valley.

Train-hopping is when you secretly catch a ride on a railroad freight car. The enormous change between how you perceive the train before jumping on it and the world you are in while riding in it was described by my friends as a Temporary Autonomous Zone. What I want to give an audience is the liberating experience of using something in a manner other than what it was specifically intended for.’Born in Jerusalem, Ariel Schlesinger left high school behind and moved to Santa Cruz, California, where he met a community of forest punks. That was the starting point of his independent life. In his practice he tries to reverse the order of production, going backwards from the finished item to the prototype, as if to choose one product out of a million, restore its identity and invent it anew.Symmetries and asymmetries in physics (energy vs. entropy)Vid Stojevic will try to describe the deep relation between conserved quantities, such as energy/charge/momentum and the symmetries of the physical theories describing these. Contrasting this, the main feature of entropy is its intrinsic asymmetry. Understanding the fundamental reasons for this asymmetry is still a controversial question within the physics community. Stojevic will attempt to give an overview of the various – sometimes widely opposing – points of view on this issue.",

Jaar has shown at many Biennales and at Documenta in 1987 and in 2002.

Architecture evolves from the collision of political, economical, functional, logistical, cultural, structural, environmental and social interests with those as yet unnamed and unforeseen.Bjarke Ingels set up Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) in 2005.

The all-consuming effort to follow these events seldom leaves time to contemplate the explanations themselves. Volume 20 is dedicated to the art of Storytelling. It presents the storylines of current events to show that while the truth is important, so is the ability of fiction to elevate fact. Perhaps the best way to eventually understand our era and to create architecture itself is through narratives that distort, pervert and animate reality? During challenging times, when it appears impossible to chart a path out of the forest of uncertainty, maybe fantasy can help to build a precise and concrete story for architecture's future.",

The all-consuming effort to follow these events seldom leaves time to contemplate the explanations themselves. Volume 20 is dedicated to the art of Storytelling. It presents the storylines of current events to show that while the truth is important, so is the ability of fiction to elevate fact. Perhaps the best way to eventually understand our era and to create architecture itself is through narratives that distort, pervert and animate reality? During challenging times, when it appears impossible to chart a path out of the forest of uncertainty, maybe fantasy can help to build a precise and concrete story for architecture's future.",

Using biological polymers as building materials, he develops liquid, jelly-like and rigid 3D membranes as a kind of human-scale biological fabricator under different gravitation conditions: on earth, underwater and in space.In the workshop a group of students will learn how to design a human-scale biological enclosure. The workshop will culminate in an Evening Lecture by Zbigniew Oksiuta on his research into biological futures and the Workshop in progress at 6.00 on Thursday 5 November in the Lecture Hall and a public presentation of the week’s work on Friday 6 November.",

Perhaps the most precocious of its six core members, Mike \"Spider\" Webb sprigged to public attention with his 4th year project published as early as in 1959. However it was his thesis project two years later, the Sin Centre for Entertainments in Leicester Square (1961-2), what granted him international recognition. The most celebrated and widely published work during the formation years of the group, the Sin Centre was repeatedly rejected by his examiners, and Webb was awarded his diploma only in 1972. After the presentation, a roundtable discussion will be held by former Archigram members Mike Webb, David Greene and Dennis Crompton. ",

In 1962 he designed the first James Bond film, Dr No, and six subsequent Bonds until Moonraker in 1979. Adam’s design for the war room in Stanley Kubrick’s Dr. Strangelove (1962) became an icon of Cold War paranoia, and his minutely detailed period sets for Barry Lyndon (1974) and The Madness of King George (1994) both earned him Academy Awards.

In the case of information, the relationship between public and private becomes a complicated set of liabilities. At the beginning of the twentieth century, information control generated a visual register called the Data Protection Pattern (DPP), which helped to veil personal information in print media like envelopes and shipping forms. Letters and numbers, and other semiotic ingredients are used in excess to create a speechless slurry of text. Today, a new global network of unsecured data transfer has still to be resolved. While DPP continues to proliferate in print media, it provides the model for carriers of electronic information, which are physically erased by overwriting the entire data carrier, or at least in the sectors used, with a confusion of pattern. The sheer spectrum of data protection patterns from letters, numbers and logos to camouflaged and ornamental graphics can be read as a kind of primordial soup of our time, all denied any meaning and yet offering a strategic field from which to generate an ambivalent space, to thicken the skin of discretion, to inhabit the flatness of exposure and control and to celebrate the deep surface of public life.",

        "detail": "Learning from Las Vegas is primarily known for the theory of the decorated shed vs. the duck in contemporary architecture. There have only been partial attempts to locate the contents of this influential urbanistic study within the discourse on the image of the city prevalent in the 1950s and 1960s. For Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, traditional visual techniques were no longer adequate for the analysis and representation of the city. Therefore, they used photography and film both as a means of analysis and argumentation. This lecture presents original film footage and photographs from the 1968 Learning from Las Vegas research, some of which has only been made accessible to the public in the ongoing international travelling exhibition, Las Vegas Studio. \u000b\u000bMartino Stierli studied art history at the University of Zurich. His PhD thesis, titled Learning from Las Vegas (ETH Zurich), won the Theodor Fischer Prize 2008 and is currently being revised for publication. He is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Basel, working on a project on the collage principle in architecture. Stierli is also a lecturer at the University of Zurich and at the ETH Zurich.",

The structure of the book is highly systemised and catalogued, reflecting the presentation of material in the current AA exhibition, which is illustrated through eight architectural projects, each examined through a specific lens – a collaboration with a photographer or an artist, for example, an unexpected construction detail or the exploration of an original sketch. Exercising a recurring, almost obsessional process, Hebbelinck creates a personal universe of ephemera populated by a mass of different taxonomies – photographs of shadows and tables after a meal, chalk drawings, notebooks with sketches, texts and collages. Similar recurring methodologies accompany the production of the studio’s architectural work.",

        "detail": "Pier Paolo Pasolini initially theorised free indirect discourse in cinema in his 1965 speech Cinema of Poetry. Prior to this, Pasolini had made the film Il Vangelo Secondo Matteo, during the making of which he questioned whether he, an atheist Marxist, could make a film about Christ through the eyes of a religious person. As Deleuze explains, Pasolini discovered how to go beyond the two elements of the traditional story  the objective-indirect story from the cameras point of view and the subjective-direct story from the characters point of view  using free indirect discourse. In the cinema of poetry the distinction between what the character saw subjectively and what the camera saw objectively vanished, not in favour of one or the other, but because the camera assumed a subjective presence, acquired an internal vision, which entered into a relation of simulation with the characters way of seeing. The author takes a step towards his characters, but the characters take a step towards the author: double becoming.\u000b\u000bNow that architecture is part of the global culture industry, the method of free indirect discourse could be of decisive importance when we want to make architecture political again. An analysis through the lens of free indirect discourse and its spatial and aesthetic implications will encompass the work of contemporary architecture practices.\u000b\u000bRoemer van Toorn is an Amsterdam-based architect, writer, curator and photographer in the field of architecture. As professor at the Berlage Institute, he runs and coordinates the Projective Theory programme, and is a staff member of the Delft School of Design at TU Delft. He also lectures internationally. Van Toorn is co-author with Ole Bouman of The Invisible in Architecture, an editor of the annual publication Architecture in the Netherlands and an advisor for Volume and Abitare magazines.\u000b\u000bThis lecture was the keynote address at the PhD Dialogues Symposium 2009.",

His reach defines the meaning of community in the television age. And what is Pfeiffer doing with technology? Like the scientist turned insect in the sci-fi classic The Fly, Jordan is an experiment in human evolution: an exceptional talent re-packaged and distributed by Turner Sports and David Stern; grafted with 16M parts Nike, 5M parts Bijan Cologne, 5M parts Gatorade, 4M parts MCI WorldCom, and 2M parts Rayovac Battery'. Paul Pfeiffers groundbreaking 'video sculptures' explore the relations between race, religion, commerce, art and philosophy. Using digital technologies to dissect the role that mass media plays in shaping consciousness, much of Pfeiffers work addresses the question of the real and of historical visibility or invisibility within the image. Assimilating found footage and images from pop culture, Pfeiffer invites viewers to project their own fears and obsessions onto the art object.

This lecture series opposes the contemporary elevation of mourning and insists upon the productive role of destruction.This lecture series concerns the destruction of cities and urban objects. It is not a material history of such destruction, but rather an investigation of why the city is central to the issue of destructiveness. It concentrates upon the stories and fantasies of such destruction and the reasoning about their causes. A sequence of case histories leads to an investigation of the issue of destruction in modernity. Behind the optimism of the Enlightenment has fallen the shadow of a distinctly modern relation to destruction, one which defines a contemporary melancholy. The series concludes by opposing such melancholy as well as by guarding against any optimism.",

The argument of this paper, however, is that many recent attempts to theorize and imagine such a politics have been limited by virtue of an anachronistic recourse to spatial and philosophical models of the polis in efforts to articulate, conceptually, emergent forms of social collectivity today. Specifically, it will be argued, these reflect a failure to confront the reality of the metropolis as a fundamentally abstract new kind of urban form, born of nineteenth-century industrial capitalism. Critically engaging with the recent work of urban theorists, this argument is given specific focus by a consideration of the extraordinary political and theoretical afterlife of Henri Lefebvres notoriously enigmatic notion of a right to the city, arguing that if this is not to be reduced to a merely romantic anti-capitalist gesture, such an idea needs to be re-inscribed as a properly modern right to the metropolis.

His research interests include the archaeology of mind and the anthropology of the brain artefact-interface (BAI)  covering topics extending from early stone tools and the exographic symbolic technologies of more recent periods, to the latest developments in neuro-prosthetics and cognitive enhancement. His research aims at developing ways to understand the long-term implications and causal efficacy of material culture in the functional architecture of the human brain and the evolution of human intelligence (especially with reference to human capacities related to self awareness, memory, theory of mind, agency and the body schema). For the last few years he has been working on the Material Engagement approach to the study of mind and the archaeology of extended and distributed cognition. Malfouris also participates in the European Platform for Life Sciences, Mind Sciences, and the Humanities (Volkswagen Stiftung).\u000b\u000bPart of the 'Embodied Patterns' Lecture Series.",

Furthermore, it frames the role of the designer in the built environment as well as possible strategies and/or actions that can be taken upon encountering different projects and diverse contexts. The accompanying exhibition, organised as a series of research lines, synthesises the most significant worldwide case studies of each of the ten approaches and traces back its precedents and referents, establishing a theoretical framework and critical assessment of the different lines of work. Each 'wallpaper background' is an abstraction of a particular urban condition that relates to the underlying structure and scale of each research line.\u000b\u000bAccompanying an AA exhibition curated by Joan Busquets in collaboration with Felipe Correa.\u000b\u000bJoan Busquets is Professor of Planning Practice at Harvard Graduate School of Design; Director of Barcelona Arquitectura y Urbanismo (BAU) and former Director of Barcelonas Planning Department during the 1992 Olympics.",

This lecture series opposes the contemporary elevation of mourning and insists upon the productive role of destruction.This lecture series concerns the destruction of cities and urban objects. It is not a material history of such destruction, but rather an investigation of why the city is central to the issue of destructiveness. It concentrates upon the stories and fantasies of such destruction and the reasoning about their causes. A sequence of case histories leads to an investigation of the issue of destruction in modernity. Behind the optimism of the Enlightenment has fallen the shadow of a distinctly modern relation to destruction, one which defines a contemporary melancholy. The series concludes by opposing such melancholy as well as by guarding against any optimism.",

In this respect, moving closer to the artwork involves moving away from the artwork  to look closer at fringes and margins and representations, and ask what seems to be a very fundamental question: to what extent are these various exhibition conventions actually part of the art  and not merely an extension of it? How might it be that 'art' is subsumed by the various representations that we make for it? This talk will focus on situations in which the representations are art  not merely re-presentations of art.\u000b\u000bArtist Joseph Grigely's lecture 'Exhibition Prosthetics' is the first in the Excursus lecture and publication series initiated by Bedford Press, a small-scale private press and publisher operating under the auspices of the Architectural Association.",
